Lesson one, get an additional 30 minutes of sleep a night. Take it as a challenge, try to find the space, quiet your mind, and get your 30 minutes of sleep and you'll see it makes a really, really big difference. My sleep habits were horrendous, to say the least I've always had a hard time sleeping. You know I couldn't figure out how to shut my brain off. So...what made the light bulb come on is that I went out there and played a game and I played like crap and I was like, "Why am I playing like a crap because I've been practicing these same moves over and over and over, but yet, I couldn't execute them properly." I was feeling sluggish, I was feeling lethargic and I knew it wasn't because of my training because I'd trained obsessively. So I started looking at other things. And that's when I came to the realization that, hey Kobe, you're not 21 years old anymore, buddy, like...maybe that has something to do with the fact that you're playing like crap, and that's when I started really evaluating those things.

And I'd say lesson two would be just five minutes of quiet time. Five minutes for you to be mindful. And to just sit and find that inner voice and just kinda listen to the self, and preferably would be in the morning as you start your day. I meditate everyday. I meditate everyday and I do it in the morning and I do it for about 10 to 15 minutes. And I think it's important because it just sets me up for the rest of the day. You know, it helps me it's like having an anchor. If I don't do it, I feel like I'm constantly chasing the day as opposed to being able to be controlled and dictate the day. Not that you're calling the shots on that comes forward, but the fact that I am set and ready for whatever may come my way. I have a calmness about whatever comes my way and a poise and that comes from starting the morning off with meditation.

For me, it's really just listening to my inner self. That's basically it. Like, you sit in silence and you just allow these thoughts to come forward and you get a chance to observe the self, and things that maybe lying beneath the surface that, if you don't have that time to sit quietly on your own, you'll never pay attention to. Cause if you think about it, like, you know, the reality is we're paying attention to so many things that are going on around us. We are constantly taking selfies, we're constantly taking pictures to post on Instagram and all these other things. We're constantly observing everything that's around us but we don't take the time to really observe what's going on inside of ourselves. That's what meditation is for me.

In 2000, we had a new head coach that come to the Los Angeles Lakers by the name of Phil Jackson. And Phil was just coming off of winning six championships with the Bulls. And he was really big on mindfulness and really big on meditation. And it wasn't an options for us. So we'd sit in our film room, and he'd turn the lights out and we would meditate as a group and he'd teach us mindfulness. And it really connected with me because he was teaching mindfulness through something that I was extremely passionate about, which was the game of basketball. So it was told through the lens of this is going to help you here. So I had this curiosity about it. And that was my introduction to meditation. And then seeing the poise that we played with. The fact that we can be in a hostile enviroment with fans yelling and screaming, and you know, pressure situations and it having no effect on us. Because we were never too high, never too low. We were just in the moment and felt very secure in who we were and that was my introduction to meditation.

I had a great experience which really I learned a lot about meditation through this experience, I was on a jet ski and I took the jet ski out in the ocean and I just kinda sat. And I just let the current just take me wherever it was gonna take me and I really saw a lot of meditation through that moment because I wasn't trying to control the moment. I wasn't trying to force myself upon the waves and dictate where I was gonna go, I just let the waves take me there. And there was a lot of peacefulness involved in that.

#### Lesson one, get an additional 30 minutes of sleep a night. Take it as a challenge, try to find that space, quiet your mind, and get your 30 minutes of sleep and you'll see it makes a really, really big difference. My sleep habits were `horrendous`, to say the least I've always had a hard time sleeping. You know I couldn't figure out how to shut my brain off. So...what made the light bulb come on is that I went out there and played a game and I palyed like crap and I was like, "Why am I playing like crap because I've been practicing these same moves over and over and over, but yet, I couldn't execute them properly." I was feeling `sluggish`, I was feeling `lethargic` and I knew it wasn't because of my training because I'd trained `obsessively`. So then I started looking at other things. And that's when I came to the realization that, hey Kobe, you're not 21 years old anymore, buddy, like...maybe the fact that you're sleeping two, three hours a night, maybe that has something to do with the fact that you're playing like crap, and that's when I started really evaluating those things.
第一点：每天多睡30分钟，把这当作一个挑战，试着找个适合的地方，让你的大脑安静下来，然后睡30分钟，然后你会发现这对你有很大很大的影响。我的睡眠习惯曾经很糟糕，往轻了说，我总是谁不好。我不知道怎么让我的大脑安静下来。真正让我恍然大悟的是有一次我打了场比赛，我打得很烂，然后我就想：“为啥我打的这么烂？因为我一直在不断重复练习某个动作，但却仍无法恰当的运用。”我感到迟钝，感觉无精打采，我知道这并非源自我的训练，因为我一直都是沉浸式训练。因此，我开始思考其他东西，然后我意识到，科比，你已不再是21岁了，伙计，也许每晚睡两三个小时这个事和你打的烂有关系，我就是在那个时候开始认真评估这件事的。

第二点：5分钟的宁静时光。用5分钟把你的思维集中在当下。坐在那里，找到内心的声音，然后去倾听自己的声音，最好是在早上，当你开启全新一天的时候。我每天都会冥想，并且我会在早上冥想，我会冥想10到15分钟。我觉得这很重要，因为它会让我做好准备应对这一天。它会帮助我，就像吃了个定心丸，如果我不冥想，我会觉得自己好像在不断地追赶那一天一样，而不是沉着冷静，去支配这一天。倒不是说你在操纵接下来发生的事，而是我会蓄势待发，迎接任何发生在我身上的事。对任何即将发生在我身上的事，我都会感到沉着自信，这源自于我以冥想开启我的造成。

对我来说，核心就是倾听自己内心的声音。基本就是这样，你安静地坐在那里，让那些想法出现在脑海，你就有机会去观察自己，观察那些潜藏在表面之下，如果你不静坐，你就永远不会注意到的东西。仔细想想，你会发现事实是，我们关乎了太多身边发生的事，我们总是在自拍，总是为了发Ins而拍照，以及所有其他事。我们总是在不停观察身边的事，但我们却不会花时间真正观察下我们内心发生的变化。对我来说，冥想就是这个用处。

2000年时，我们有一个新教练来到洛杉矶湖人，他叫菲尔·杰克逊。菲尔来的时候，已经和公牛队赢得了6个总冠军。他对“专注当下”和“冥想”非常感兴趣，但我们当时不会这么做。所以我们会做在影像室里，菲尔会把灯关掉，我们会作为一个团体去冥想，他会叫我们专注于当下，而我对此深有感触，因为他是在通过我极为热爱的事情，也就是篮球比赛，来叫我们专注与当下。所以他教我们的视角时：冥想会对你这个地方有帮助，所以我当时对冥想产生了好奇，那是我第一次接触到冥想，并且看到我们打球时用到的沉着冷静。就是说，我们会处在一个敌对的环境中，粉丝会大喊大叫，各种高压场景，而这不会对我们造成影响，因为我们总是内心平和，我们就处在那个点，并且对于我们是谁充满了安全感。这就是我对冥想的初体验。

我有个很棒的经历，通过这次经历，我学到了很多关于冥想的东西。我当时在一艘摩托艇上，我开着摩托艇驶入大海，然后我就那么坐着，我只是让水流带我去任何它要带我去的地方，通过那次，我领悟了很多冥想的东西。因为我并未试图控制那个时刻，也没有强制自己去哪，我只是在随波逐流。那个过程非常平静。
