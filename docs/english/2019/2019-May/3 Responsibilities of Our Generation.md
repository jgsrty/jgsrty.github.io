>肩负我们这一代的责任

## 翻译
#### And over the last few years, we have seen a `groundswell` of action by goverments to improve their laws and to work across borders to fight the traffickers.
再过去的几年里，我们看到了许多政府发起实际行动，通过加强法规和跨境联合执法打击走私者。
#### Only last month, President Xi announced that China would take steps to halt the `domestic` trade in ivory, adding to the ban on ivory carving imports he announced in Feburary.
就在上个月，习近平主席宣布中国会采取措施遏制国内象牙交易，他今年二月份也宣布禁止象牙雕刻的进口。
#### But we know the illegal wildlife trade cannot be solved by governments alone.
但是我们知道仅仅依靠政府试无法解决非法野生生物贸易的。
#### The spotlight falls back on all of us, and on the choices we have to make to play our parts in addressing this problem.
焦点重新回到了我们身上，我们要做出决定贡献自己的力量，共同去解决这个问题。
#### We have to accept the truth: that consumers are driving the demand for animal body parts -- for arts, for `trinkets`, or for medicine.
我们必须承认：是消费者驱动了对动物身体制作的艺术品、装饰和药物的需求。
#### Only we as consumers can put the wildlife traffickers out of business by ending our demand for their products. I know we can do this.
只有我们这些消费者不再购买他们的产品，才能让野生生物走私者的生意倒闭。
#### The desire to `possess` animal `trophies` or `ornaments` made from ivory has been felt on every `continent` for centuries.
我知道我们对动物制品和象牙饰品的渴求已经在各个大洲上延续了数个世纪。
#### I know this topic is sensitive for many families.
我知道对于许多家庭来说这是个敏感的话题。
#### For example, until a hundred years ago, my ancestors were those who had little concern about `acquiring` ivory without knowledge of the `threats` of extinction, `corruption` and violence that the ivory trade would lead to.
例如，直到100年前，我的祖先还像其他人一样热衷于获取象牙，丝毫没有意识到象牙贸易会导致怎样的灭绝、腐败和暴力。
#### My rejection of ivory today is not a judgment of past generations.
我今天反对象牙贸易并不是对上几代人的妄加评断。
#### It is an acceptance of the world as I find it today, and the world that I want my children, George and Charitte, to inherit.
我发现这也是当今世界都认同的，一个我想让自己的孩子--乔治和夏洛特继承的世界。
#### Likewise, those doctors and medical practitioners in China who are speaking out against endangered species in medicines.
类似的，那些在中国反对在药材中使用濒危物种的医生和从医者。
#### They are not judging previous generations who did not have the facts that you do today.
他们不是在批评那些前辈，我们的前辈们不想今天的你们了解这么多信息。
#### They are just accepting the truth: that all `credible` `evidence` and scientific research shows, for example, the rihno horn cannot cure cancer.
他们只是接受了所有科学研究结果和可靠证据，例如，犀牛角并不能治疗癌症。
#### We have a responsibility to act on the facts that we have today.
我们有责任根据我们当下的事实而行动。
#### By doing so, we are honoring the generations that have come before us and we are protecting those that are yet to come.
这是对付出努力的前辈的尊重，也是对后来人的保护。

## 原文阅读
And over the last few years, we have seen a groundswell of action by goverments to improve their laws and to work across borders to fight the traffickers.

Only last month, President Xi announced that China would take steps to halt the domestic trade in ivory, adding to the ban on ivory carving imports he announced in Feburary.

But we know the illegal wildlife trade cannot be solved by governments alone.

The spotlight falls back on all of us, and on the choices we have to make to play our parts in addressing this problem.

We have to accept the truth: that consumers are driving the demand for animal body parts -- for arts, for trinkets, or for medicine.

Only we as consumers can put the wildlife traffickers out of business by ending our demand for their products. I know we can do this.

The desire to possess animal trophies or ornaments made from ivory has been felt on every continent for centuries.

I know this topic is sensitive for many families.

For example, until a hundred years ago, my ancestors were those who had little concern about acquiring ivory without knowledge of the threats of extinction, corruption and violence that the ivory trade would lead to.

My rejection of ivory today is not a judgment of past generations.

It is an acceptance of the world as I find it today, and the world that I want my children, George and Charitte, to inherit.

Likewise, those doctors and medical practitioners in China who are speaking out against endangered species in medicines.

They are not judging previous generations who did not have the facts that you do today.

They are just accepting the truth: that all credible evidence and scientific research shows, for example, the rhino horn cannot cure cancer.

We have a responsibility to act on the facts that we have today.

By doing so, we are honoring the generations that have come before us and we are protecting those that are yet to come.
