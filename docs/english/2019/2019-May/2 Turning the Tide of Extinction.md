#### Today we face an `unprecedented` `surge` in the `brutal` `slaughter` of iconic animals by `poachers`.

#### In South Africa, for example, one `rhino` was kiiled every month until 2005.

#### But last year, three rhinos were killed every single day.

#### In the 33 years since I was born, we have lost around 70% of Africa's elephant population.

#### That is 54 elephants killed every single day.

#### Those who suffer the most from this loss are some of the poorest people on our planet.
从中受害最多的就是地球上最为贫穷的人们。
#### They are the families who feel powerless as wildlife around them disapper, who face being trapped in poverty forever, without the income that should be brought in by tourism, a cornerstone of the economy in many developing nations.
他们只能眼睁睁的看着周围的野生动物消失而没有得到旅游业带来的收入，这让他们永远深陷贫困的泥潭，而旅游业正式许多发展中国家的经济基石。
#### They are the children whose parents risk their lives in the fight against poachers.
有些孩子的父母冒着声明危险跟偷猎者抗争。
#### In the last few days, three `rangers` and one member of the armed `forces` were killed by peachers in one `incident` in Central Africa, leaving behind 14 children between them.
就在前些天，三位护林员和以为武装部队成员在中非一起事件中被偷猎者杀害了，抛下了14个孩子。
#### It is these children's future that is `blighted` so `tragically` by the illegal wildlife trade, and it is their birthright that is stolen.

#### That knowledge brings responsibility: the responsibility to do every thing in our power to reverse the march towards eradications of these fine animals.

#### The good news is that we are far from powerless in this struggle.

#### We know where the animals we are trying to protect live.

## 原文阅读
Today we face an unprecedented surge in the brutal slaughter of iconic animals by poachers.

In South Africa, for example, one rhino was killed every month until 2005.

But last year, three rhinos were killed every single day.

In the 33 years since I was born, we have lost around 70% of Africa's elephant population.

Of those that are left, 20,000 are being killed every year.

That is 54 elephants killed every single day.

At this rate, children born this year, like my daughter Charlotte, will see the last wild elephants and rhinos die before their 25th birthdays.

Those who suffer the most from this loss are some of the poorest people on our planet.

They are the families who feel powerless as wildlife around them disapper, who face being trapped in poverty forever, without the income that should be brought in by tourism, a cornerstone of the economy in many developing nations.

They are the children whose parents risk their lives in the fight against poachers.

In the last few days, three rangers and one member of the armed forces were killed by poachers in one incident in Central Africa, leaving behind 14 children between them.

It is these children's future that is blighted so tragically by the illegal wildlife trade, and it is their birthright that is stolen.

There is no hiding from these facts today.

On our phones, laptops and our TV screens, we can see the images and read the reports that lay bare the truth of this crisis.

That knowledge brings responsibility: the responsibility to do every thing in our power to reverse the march towards eradications of these fine animals.

The good news is that we are far from powerless in this struggle.

We can turn the tide of extinction.

We know where the animals we are trying to protect live.

We know many of the roads, the airports and ports criminals use to transfer their cargo, from killed fields to marketplace.
