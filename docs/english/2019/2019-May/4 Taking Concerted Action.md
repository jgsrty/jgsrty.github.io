### Taking Concerted Action
>通力合作，保护动物

## 翻译
#### I do not think that anyone would stand and watch an elephant or rhino being killed.
我不相信我们当中任何一个人能够忍心看着一头大象或犀牛被杀害。
#### Or a ranger being gunned down because we wanted a `bracelet` or an `ornament` to impress someone else as a gift.
也或者是以为护林员被杀害，就因为我们想要一个手镯或者饰品送给某人当作礼物。
#### But that is what the demand for wildlife products means in practice.
但那就是人们对野生动物的需求所造就的事实。
#### The decisions we make as consumers affect the lives of ordinary people thousands and thousands of miles away, in countries we may never visit.
我们作为消费者所做的决定会影响到数千里之外普通人的生活，他们生活在我们从没有去过的国家。
#### If we buy illegal wildlife products, we are contributing to the extinction of whole species.
如果我们购买野生动物制品，我们就是在促成整个野生生物的灭绝。
#### But there is good news, and if you remember one thing, I want you to remember this: We can win the battle. Each generation decides what it values.
但也是有好消息，如果你们要记住一件事，那我希望你们记住这一点：我们能够赢得这场斗争，每一代人都会决定他们自己的使命。
#### Each generation can determine what we consider to be beautiful on the one hand, or unacceptable, or `immoral` on the other.
每一代人都可以衡量出美好的一面，和不可接收的、不道德的另一面。
#### We can act in `solidarity` with those fighting `poaching` and trafficking in their communities.
我们可以和那些打击偷猎和走私的人一起行动起来。
#### I am absolutely convinced that China can become a global leader in the protection of wildlife.
我完全相信中国能在保护野生动物方面成为全球的领导者。
#### Your influence in the world means you can change the face of `conservation` in this century.
你们在这个世界的影响力意味着你们可以改变这个世纪自然保护的现状。
#### This will be a contribution that would go down in history, one that your great grandchildren would speak of with great pride.
这将是一个名垂青史的贡献，你们的子孙说起它时都会无比自豪。
#### The greatest inheritance we can pass on to the next generation is a safe and `sustainable` environment, the priceless `endowment` of nature.
我们可以留给后代最宝贵的遗产就是一个安全、可持续发展的环境，这是大自然无价的馈赠。
#### Let us not tell our children the sad `tale` of how we watched as the last elephants, rhinos and tigers died out, but the `inspiring` story of how we turned the tide and preserved them for all humanity.
让我们不要告诉我们的孩子我们时怎样眼睁睁看着最后一只大象、犀牛和老虎死去的。我们要鼓舞他们，告诉他们我们是怎样逆转潮流，为全人类保护了这些动物。
#### And in so doing, let us show the world that by working together we can stand up to the great challenges our planet and our familys will face in the generations to come.
这样做，让我们告诉全世界，通过我们一起的努力可以共同面对这个星球和我们的家庭在未来几代将会面临的挑战

## 原文阅读
I do not think that anyone would stand and watch an elephant or rhino being killed.

Or a ranger being gunned down because we wanted a bracelet or an ornament to impress someone else as a gift.

But that is what the demand for wildlife products means in practice.

The decisions we make as consumers affect the lives of ordinary people thousands and thousands of miles away, in countries we may never visit.

If we buy illegal wildlife products, we are contributing to the extinction of whole species.

But there is good news, and if you remember one thing, I want you to remember this: We can win the battle. Each generation decides what it values.

Each generation can determine what we consider to be beautiful on the one hand, or unacceptable, or immoral on the other.

We can act in solidarity with those fighting poaching and trafficking in their communities.

I am absolutely convinced that China can become a global leader in the protection of wildlife.

Your influence in the world means you can change the face of conservation in this century.

This will be a contribution that would go down in history, one that your great grandchildren would speak of with great pride.

The greatest inheritance we can pass on to the next generation is a safe and sustainable environment, the priceless endowment of nature.

Let us not tell our children the sad tale of how we watched as the last elephants, rhinos and tigers died out, but the inspiring story of how we turned the tide and preserved them for all humanity.

And in so doing, let us show the world that by working together we can stand up to the great challenges our planet and our familys will face in the generations to come.
