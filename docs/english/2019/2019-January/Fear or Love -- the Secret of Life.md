# 人生选择-爱与恐惧
### Fear or Love -- the Secret of Life
>Jim Carrey

## 翻译
#### Our eyes are not viewers. They're also projectors that are running a second story over the picture that we see in front of us all the time. Fear is writing that script.

#### Now fear is going to be a player in your life, but you get to decide how much. You can spend your whole life imagining ghosts, worrying about the pathway to the future, but all there will ever be is what's happening here and the decisions we make in this moment, which are based in either love or fear.

#### So many of us choose our path out of fear `disguised` as `practicality`. What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and `ridiculous` to expect, so we never dare to ask the `universe` for it.

#### I'm saying that you can ask the universe for it.

#### Life dosen't happen to you, it happens for you. As far as I can tell, it's just about letting the universe know what you want and working toward it, while letting go of how it comes to pass.

#### Why not take a chance on faith? Not `religion`, but faith. Not hope, but faith.

#### I don't believee in hope. Hope is a begger. Hope walks through the fire and faith leaps over it.

#### You are ready and able to do beautiful things in this world and after you walk through those doors today, you will only ever have two choices, love or fear.

#### Choose love, and don't ever let fear turn you against your playful heart.


我们的眼睛不仅可以观看，还可以用来投影，播放我们‘人生胶卷’上的故事，也就是我们的日常所见。恐惧也在撰写这个剧本。

恐惧在你的生活中扮演着重要的角色，但是由你来决定它占据多少戏份。你可以穷尽一生想象鬼怪，担忧通往未来的道路，但往后的一切都与正在发生的事有关，与此刻我们基于热枕或恐惧做出的决定有关。

很多人在选择道路时被伪装成现实的恐惧所欺骗。我们心之所想看似遥不可及，荒诞不经，所以我们从来不敢向宇宙索取。

但是我想说，你可以向宇宙索取。

生活并非碰巧发生，而是为你绽放。据我所知，你只需要让世界知道你的渴求，并为此努力，并不需要在意一切是如何发生的。

为什么不给信念一个机会呢，不是宗教，而是信念，不是希望，而是信念。

我不相信希望。希望是乞丐，希望带你穿过熊熊烈火，而信念让你一跃而过。

你拥有为世界创造美好事物的能力，今天当你离开学校的大门，会面临两个抉择：热枕或恐惧。

选择热枕，别让恐惧泯灭你热衷的心。

## 原文阅读
Our eyes are not viewers. They're also projectors that are running a second story over the picture that we see in front of us all the time. Fear is writing that script.

Now fear is going to be a player in your life, but you get to decide how much. You can spend your whole life imagining ghosts, worrying about the pathway to the future, but all there will ever be is what's happening here and the decisions we make in this moment, which are based in either love or fear.

So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality. What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect, so we never dare to ask the universe for it.

I'm saying that you can ask the universe for it.

Life dosen't happen to you, it happens for you. As far as I can tell, it's just about letting the universe know what you want and working toward it, while letting go of how it comes to pass.

Why not take a chance on faith? Not religion, but faith. Not hope, but faith.

I don't believe in hope. Hope is a bagger. Hope walks through the fire and faith leaps over it.

You are ready and able to do beautiful things in this world and after you walk through those doors today, you will only ever have two choices, love or fear.

Choose love, and don't ever let fear turn you against your playful heart.
