# 生命的故事
### The Story of Life

## 翻译
#### Sometime people come into your life and you knew right away that they were meant to be there, to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson, or to help you figure out who you are or who you want to become.
有时候，一些人来到你的生活里，你马山就知道他们是注定要出现，他们的到来是为了达成某种目的，给你提供教训，帮你人情自己或自己想要成为怎样的人。
#### You never know who these people may be (possibly your roommate, neighbor, coworker, long lost friend, lover, or even a complete stranger), but when you lock eyes with them, you know at that very moment they will affect your life in some `profound` way.
你永远不知道这些人是谁（可能会是你的室友、邻居、同事、失散多年的朋友、爱人，甚至是素未谋面的谋生人），可是当你的目光锁定他们的那一刻，你就知道他们会给你的生命带来深远的影响。
#### And sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair at first, but in reflection you find that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, willpower, or heart.
有时候，发生在你身上的事情一开始看似可怕、痛苦、不公平，但在深思后，你就会发现如果不克服那些障碍，你就不会意识到自己的潜能、力量、意志和决心。
#### Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck.
任何事情发生都是有原因的，没有什么是偶然出现或运气使然。
#### Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness, and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul.
痛苦、伤痛、爱情、与成功的失之交臂，以及彻彻底底的糊涂犯错，这些都是对你精神极限的考验。
#### Without this small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere.
无论这些小小的考验是什么，没有了它们，生命就像一条不知通往何处的平坦大道。
#### It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and `utterly` pointless.
纵然安全舒适、但却了然无趣，毫无意义。
##### The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and `downfalls` you experience, help to create who you are and who you become.
你所遇到的影响你生活的人，你所经历的成功与失败，都有助于塑造和成就你但人生。
#### Even the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most `poignant` ones.
即使是不好但经历，也能从中吸取教训。事实上，这些经验才是最深刻和最重要的
#### If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious when you open your heart.
如果有人伤害了你，背叛了你，或伤了你的心，原谅他们吧，因为他们让你学到了信任，让你懂得了在敞开心扉时保持谨慎是很重要的。
#### If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things.
如果有人爱你，你要无条件的爱他们，不仅因为他们爱你，还因为他们教会了你如何去爱，以及如何敞开你的心扉、拓宽你的眼界。
#### Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can for you may never be able to experience it again.
让每一天都过的有价值。珍惜生命中的每一刻，并尽你所能地从中取得收获，因为你不会有从头再来的可能。

## 原文阅读
Sometime people come into your life and you knew right away that they were meant to be there, to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson, or to help you figure out who you are or who you want to become.

You never know who these people may be (possibly your roommate, neighbor, coworker, long lost friend, lover, or even a complete stranger), but when you lock eyes with them, you know at that very moment they will affect your life in some profound way.

And sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair at first,  but in reflection you find that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, willpower, or heart.

Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck.

Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness, and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul.

Without this small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere.

It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless.

The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience, help to create who you are and who you become.

Even the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant ones.

If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious when you open your heart.

If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things.

Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can for you may never be able to experience it again.

Talk to people that you have never talked to before, and actually listen.

Let yourself fall in love, breakfree, and set your sights high.

Hold your head up because you have every right to.

Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don't believe in yourself, it will be hard for others to believe in you.

You can make of your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it with absolutely no regrets.

Most importantly, if you love someone tell him or her, for you never know what tomorrow may have in store.

And learn a lesson in life each day that you live.

That's the story of life.
