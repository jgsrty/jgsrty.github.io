#### The first thing I want you to take away from today is this: you will have good days, and you will have bad days. But you will always learn something more or something new, and you'll learn more overall on bad days than good days.
今天，我想要你们学习的第一件事是：人生有顺境也有逆境，你总能在其中学到更多和更新的事物，总体来说你会在逆境中学到更多。

你会更加了解自己，更加懂得处理人际关系，学习生活原则，培养自己的特点和品质。
#### If you're a person who wants to, let's say, improve on your character of patience, let's say, don't complain when you're waiting in a line. You ain't going to grow in a patience until you're put in a place to wait.
如果你想增强耐心，那排队时就不要抱怨。只有经历了等待，你才能增强耐心。
#### It's like you go into a gym and, you know, you walking through the front doors and, you know, you tell your wife or your husband I'm going to the gym. You got into the gym and you come in three feet, you do a U-turn and you ride out, I went to the gym. Ain't gonna do nothing.
就像你去健身房一样，你走进前门，告诉你妻子或丈夫你要去健身。可是你在走了三步之后就掉头离开了。我去健身房，但什么收获也没有。

你去了健身房，然后想要做什么呢？你可以练习举重，锻炼肌肉。

#### And I'm not `belittling` your pain and don't worry, I've seen pain in my life, and I've seen it not only in my life, but people's lives and people say well at least I have no arms and legs and then what am I supposed to say?
别担心，我不是在贬低你们的痛苦，我已经经历过我人生的痛苦，并不只是我自己的痛苦人生。一些人会说我都没手没脚了，还会说些什么呢？
#### At least I'm not an African `orphan` who's dying at four years old and I've met that person.
至少我不是一个在四岁就要面临死亡的非洲孤儿，我遇到了那个人。
#### What about the 10-years-old girl that was bought for 700 US dollars in Mamba, `kidnapped` as a sex slave, to have 350 clients before the age of 13, pregnant at 12, put the baby under the bed while she works on top, abandoned by her family.
他是一个10岁的小女孩，被家人抛弃，在曼巴以700美元被买卖，沦落为性奴，并被强制在13岁前与350位客人发生关系，当她12岁时，怀孕生下了一个孩子，于是她不得不在工作的时候把孩子藏在床底下。
#### After she pays her debt of 700 US dollars after three years with her child she leaves on the streets of Mamba hoping for a new life. No family, no job, no food.
三年后，她终于还清了700美元的债务，于是带着自己的孩子走上曼巴街头，想要开始新的生活，可她无依无靠，没有工作，没有饭吃。

她的孩子需要食物，她在街上被强奸、暴打。绝望之下，她再次选择了自己唯一知道的赚钱方式。她回到了妓院。

她见到我就大哭起来，对我说：“尼克，我刚刚发现我患上了艾滋，我也丢失了妓女的工作。”
#### What do you say to that?
你会对此说些什么呢？
#### You may have arms and legs, but unless you know three things.
你也许四肢健全，但你得知道这三件事。

#### No.3, what is your destiny when you're done here.
第一，你是谁，你的价值时什么；

## 原文阅读
The first thing I want you to take away from today is this: you will have good days, and you will have bad days. But you will always learn something more or something new, and you'll learn more overall on bad days than good days.

You'll learn more about yourself, you'll learn more about relationships, you'll learn about life and principles and you'll build your character.

If you're a person who wants to, let's say, improve on your character of patience, let's say, don't complain when you're waiting in a line. You ain't going to grow in a patience until you're put in a place to wait.

It's like you go into a gym and, you know, you walking through the front doors and, you know, you tell your wife or your husband I'm going to the gym. You go into the gym and you come in three feet, you do a U-turn and you ride out, I went to the gym. Ain't gonna do nothing.

You got to go in and what are you going to do? You're going to pick up the weights and you exercise the muscles that you want to build.

I stand before you without arms and legs, but a very strong man because of the bad days in my life. You know how it is. If you didn't go what you've gone through, you wouldn't be who you are today.

And I'm not belittling your pain and don't worry, I've seen pain in my life, and I've seen it not only in my life, but people's lives and people say well at least I have no arms and legs and then what am I supposed to say?

At least I'm not an African orphan who's dying at four years old and I've met that person.

What about the 10-year-old girl that was bought for 700 US dollars in Mamba, kidnapped as a sex slave, to have 350 clients before the age of 13, pregnant at 12, put the baby under the bed while she works on top, abandoned by her family.

After she pays her debt of 700 US dollars after three years with her child she leaves on the streets of Mamba hoping for a new life. No family, no job, no food.

Her baby needs food. She gets raped, beaten up on the street. She comes back to the only way that she knows how to make money. She gose back to the brothels.

She gets pregnant at 15 the second time and then that child dies and then at 20 years old she comes up to me, yes, I have met this woman.

She comes up crying and she says "Nick, I just found I've got HIV AIDS. And I got fired from being a prostitute."

What do you say to that?

You may have arms and legs, but unless you know three things.

No.1, who are you and what your value is;  
No.2, what is your purpose here in life;  
No.3, what is your destiny when you're done here.

If you don't know the answers of any of those three questions, you're more disabled than I.
