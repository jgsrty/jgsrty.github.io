### Thoughts on Death
>Steve Jobs 对死亡的思考

## 翻译
#### My third story is about death.
我的第三个故事是关于死亡的。
#### When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."
17岁那年，我读到了一句话，是这样说的：“如果你把每一天当作生命中最后一天来过，总有一天你会如愿以偿的。”
#### It made an `impression` on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself:"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"
这句话给我留下了深刻的印象，从那时起，33年过去了，每天早晨我都会对着镜子问自己：“如果几天是我生命的最后一天，我还会做今天想做的事情吗？”
#### And whenever the answer has been "No" for to many days in a row, I know I need to change something.
如果连续很多天我的回答都是“不”的时候，我知道我应该有所改变了。
#### Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever `encountered` to help me make the big choices in life.
记住你将会很快死去，是我遇到最有力的工具，来帮助我做生命中一些重要的决定。
#### Because almost everything -- all `external` expectations, all pride, all fear of `embarrassment` or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is trully important.
因为几乎所有的事，所有别人的期待、骄傲和所有对失败和尴尬的恐惧，这些在死亡面前都会消失，留下的才是真正重要的东西。
#### Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
记住你将随时会死去，是我知道的避免患得患失最好的方法。
#### You are already `naked`. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
你已经一无所有了，没理由不跟着自己的感觉走。
#### About a year ago I was `diagnosed` with cancer.
大概在一年前，我被诊出患有癌症。
#### I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a `tumor` on my `pancreas`. I didn't even know what a pancreas was.
那天早上7:30，我做了一个扫描检查，结果清晰的说明我的胰腺上有一个肿瘤。在那之前我甚至都不知道胰腺是什么。
#### The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is `incurable`, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.
医生告诉我这几乎是一种无法治愈的癌症，我最多还能再活三到六个月。
#### My doctor advised me to go home and get my `affairs` in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.
医生建议我回家把一切事情安排好，其实就是暗示我准备后事。
#### It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them in just a few months.
这意味着你将要在未来十几年对孩子说的话要在几个月里嘱咐完。
#### It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.
这意味着把每件事都安排妥当，让你的家人能生活的轻松些。意味着要说再见了。
#### I lived with that diagnosis all day.
我整天心里想的都是那个诊断书。
#### Later that evening I had a `biopsy`, where they `stuck` an `endoscope` down my `throat`, through my `stomach` and into my `intestines`, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.
后来一天晚上我做了一个切片检查，医生将一个内镜通过我的喉咙伸进我的胃，然后进入我的肠子，用一根针在我的胰腺的肿瘤上取下了细胞。
#### I was `sedated`, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very `rare` form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with `surgery`.
我当时被麻醉了，但我的妻子在那里。后来她告诉我，当时医生在显微镜下观察到这些细胞的时候叫了起来，因为这是一种罕见的可以通过手术治疗的胰腺癌。
#### I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.
于是我做了手术，现在我已经痊愈了。
#### This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.
那是我离死亡最近的一次，我也希望这是未来几十年最接近的一次。
#### Having lived throught it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but `purely` `intellectual` `concept`: No one wants to die.
有了这次经历后，谈论起死亡并不再是纯粹的知识方面的的概念，我可以确定的告诉你，没有人想死。
#### Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
即便有人想去天堂，也不愿意通过死去到那里。
#### And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever eacaped it.
然而死亡是我们共同的归宿，没人能逃脱。
#### And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of life.
我们注定会死，死亡或许是生命最好的一项发明。
#### It is life's change agent. It clears out the old to make for the new.
它是生命推进的动力，除旧迎新。

## 原文阅读
My third story is about death.

When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."

It made an inpression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself:"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"

And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.

I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.

It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them in just a few months.

It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

I lived with that diagnosis all day.

Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.

I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.

I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.

This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.

Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die.

Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.

And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.

And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of life.

It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make for the new.
