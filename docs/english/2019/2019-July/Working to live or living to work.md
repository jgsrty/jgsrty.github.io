# 为生活而工作，还是为工作而活
### Working to live or living to work

## 翻译
#### I read a study yesterday. It said that last year, more than half of us actually choose not to take our full vacations from our jobs.
我昨天读了一篇研究，上面显示在去年，我们中有一半的选择不休假。
#### Question: Don't you think it's crazy that so many of us go into work even when we don't need to be there? Times we could be on the beach buried in sand or traveling the earth, we spend it in the office, traveling from desk to desk, buried in paperwork.
问题是：你不觉得这么多人在不需要上班的时候还继续工作很疯狂吗？我们把本可以呆在沙滩上埋在沙里或环游世界的时间，消耗在了办公室里，在办公桌之间旅行，埋头于文书工作。
#### See, in this `chaotic` world, everything gose so fast. We're so busy -- seems like everyone's middle name is "Multitask." But now, now before you go and act all `holier-than-thou`, how many extra tabs do you have open on your computer right now?
看，在这个混乱的世界上，一切都太快了。我们如此忙碌——就好像我们每个人的中间名都是“多任务”。但现在，在你表现的假仁假义前，你的电脑上有多少多余的标签？
#### See, we all need time to get away from the race, for our family, friends, for the `sake` of our mental state, time to `rewind`, recharge, and reconnect -- not reporting to the office on emails that should be on redirect.
听着，我们需要时间来从这场竞赛中逃离，为了我们的家人、朋友和我们的精神状态，我们需要重新倒带、重新充电、重新连接的时间——而不是回复办公室那些应该被转寄出去的邮件。
#### Because life, ladies and gentlemen, is all about moments. No one in history has ever been able to hold on to one -- not a single soul. And you never get them back. See, there one gose!
因为人生，女士和先生们，所有的瞬间。历史上没有人能抓住一个时刻——没有任何人。你瞧，又一个时刻消失了！
#### No do over, no rewind, no DVD root menu to skip to a previous scene. Ask yourself, how many trips did you almost take? How many sights have you almost seen? How many moments have you lost thinking about the next one? Thinking that once you get this or get there, maybe that will be the best one?
不能重做、不能倒带、没有像DVD菜单一样可以跳回上一幕。问问你自己，你又多少次差点要去旅行？你几乎看到了多少风景？你遗失了多少时刻，思考着下一刻？认为一旦你得到了这个或去了那里，会是最好的。
#### Life has taught me that all we will ever have is "now." But let me be perfectly clear, I'm not to saying to quit your job, even though I know you deserve a six-month vacation, twice a year.
人生教会我，我们始终能拥有的就是“现在”。但让我说清楚，我不是说让你辞掉工作，即使我知道你应该有六个月的假期，一年两次。
#### But how about small steps? Short trips with long dances, no distractions. Spend time with family instead of coworkers, `meditation` instead of `aggravation`. Replace our screensavers with sunrises, Palm Pilots with palm trees, jammed copy machines with -- man, I really hate jammed copy machines.
但是踏出小小几步如何？短途旅行、长时间跳舞、无人打扰。花时间陪伴家人而非同事、花时间沉思而非生气。看真正的日出而不是电脑屏幕上的、用棕榈树代替掌上电脑，复印机用——老天，我真的恨透了复印机。
#### The most precious thing we have in life are moments. Let's make the most of them before they disappear. Let's see the world while we still can and cherish those while they're still here.
生命中最宝贵的就是每一个时刻。让我们在他们消失前好好利用。趁我们还能好好看世界，并且那些人事物还在的时候好好珍惜他们。
#### Because when our lives are almost over, it won't matter how much money we made, or hours we worked, or times we got Employee of the Month.
当我们的生命即将走到尽头的时候，我们赚了多少钱、工作了多少小时、当了几次最佳月度最佳员工都不重要了。
#### What we will look back on are the memories we made, the hours we spend with those we loved, and were we Father of the Month, Monther of the Year, Friend of a Lifetime.
我们回顾的是我们创造的美好回忆，我们和所爱的人一起度过的时光，以及我们是不是月度模范父亲、年度模范母亲、一生中的最佳好友。
#### Holidays should be a time where we go away and come together. From now on, let's take our whole vacation and be fully present -- creating memories that will last forever.
假期应该是我们走出去聚在一起的时候。从现在起，让我们好好把握所有假期并尽情享受——创造永恒的记忆。

I read a study yesterday. It said that last year, more than half of us actually choose not to take our full vacations from our jobs.

Question: Don't you think it's crazy that so many of us go into work even when we don't need to be there? Times we could be on the beach buried in sand or traveling the earth, we spend it in the office, traveling from desk to desk, buried in paperwork.

See, in this chaotic world, everything gose so fast. We're so busy -- seems like everyone's middle name is "Multitask." But now, now before you go and act all holier-than-thou, how many extra tabs do you have open on your computer right now?

See, we all need time to get away from the race, for our family, friends, for the sake of our mental state, time to rewind, recharge, and reconnect -- not reporting to the office on emails that should be on redirect.

Because life, ladies and gentlemen, is all about moments. No one in history has ever been able to hold on to one -- not a single soul. And you never get them back. See, there one gose!

No do over, no rewind, no DVD root menu to skip to a previous scene. Ask yourself, how many trips did you almost take? How many sights have you almost seen? How many moments have you lost thinking about the next one? Thinking that once you get this or get there, maybe that will be the best one?

Life has taught me that all we will ever have is "now." But let me be perfectly clear, I'm not to saying to quit your job, even though I know you deserve a six-month vacation, twice a year.

But how about small steps? Short trips with long dances, no distractions. Spend time with family instead of coworkers, meditation instead of aggravation. Replace our screensavers with sunrises, Palm Pilots with palm trees, jammed copy machines with -- man, I really hate jammed copy machines.

The most precious thing we have in life are moments. Let's make the most of them before they disappear. Let's see the world while we still can and cherish those while they're still here.

Because when our lives are almost over, it won't matter how much money we made, or hours we worked, or times we got Employee of the Month.

What we will look back on are the memories we made, the hours we spend with those we loved, and were we Father of the Month, Monther of the Year, Friend of a Lifetime.

Holidays should be a time where we go away and come together. From now on, let's take our whole vacation and be fully present -- creating memories that will last forever.
