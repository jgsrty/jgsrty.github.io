Indian officials have denounced schools for making students carry heavy school bags and giving young children homework.

Under the guidelines, no homework would be given to children in Classes 1 and 2. This will ensure that the youngest students have no books to carry home.

For students in Classes 3 to 5, the weight of a school bag would never be more than three kilograms. And bags would never weigh more than five kilograms for students in Class 10.

The Indian government noted studies that show how a heavy load can affect student's soft and developing spines.

One study by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India found that 68 percent of young children might suffer from mild back pain. The mild pain can develop into long-term back pain and affect bones of the spinal column.

The study involved more than 2,500 children between the ages of seven and 13. It found that more than 88 percent of children carried more than 45 percent of their body weight on their backs.

Many schools there have started using white boards and projectors in classes. This has reduced the number of books to be carried to school.

But in large parts of rural India, children still have to walk great distances, weighed down by heavy school bags.
