听完，微笑浮现在她脸上，我也跟着笑了起来，然后她说道：“当我七十五岁时，回想年轻时候的人生，我希望自己能记住这个时刻。”

#### We must not allow the clock, the calendar, and external pressures to rule our lives and blind us to the fact that each individual moment of our lives is a beautiful mystery and a miracle -- especially those moments we spend in the presence of a loved one.
我们不能让时钟、日历或其他任何外部的压力支配我们的生活，让我忽略这样的事实--我们人生的每一个时刻都是一个美丽的奇迹，那些与爱人一起度过的时光尤其应该倍加珍惜。

## 原文阅读
It was one warm evening many years ago.

After spending nearly every waking minute with Angel for eight straight days, I knew that I had to tell her just one thing.

So late at night, just before she fell asleep, I whispered it in her ear.

She smiled -- the kind of smile that makes me smile back -- and she said:"When I'm seventy-five and I think about my life and what it was like to be young, I hope that I can remember this very moment."

A few seconds later she closed her eyes and fell asleep.

The room was peaceful -- almost silent. All I could hear was the soft purr of her breathing.

I stayed awake thinking about the time we'd spent together and all the choices in our lives that made this moment possible.

And at some point, I realized that it didn't matter what we'd done or where we'd gone. Nor did the future hold any significance.

All that mattered was the serenity of the moment. Just being with her and breathing with her.

We must not allow the clock, the calendar, and external pressures to rule our lives and blind us to the fact that each individual moment of our lives is a beautiful mystery and a miracle -- especially those moments we spend in the presence of a loved one.
