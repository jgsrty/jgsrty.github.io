## 原文阅读
A man and his girlfriend were getting married. It was large celebration.

The bride was gorgeous in her white wedding gown and the groom was very dashing in his black suit.

Everyone could tell that the love they had for each other was true.

A few months later, the wife came to her husband with a proposal:

"I read in a magazine, a while ago, about how we can strengthen our marriage," she offered.

"Each of us will write a list of everything we find a bit annoying about the other person. Then, we can talk about how we can change these annoying things and make our life together happier."

The husband agreed, so each of them went to a separate room in the house and thought of the things that annoyed them about the other.

They thought about these things all day long and wrote down what they came up with.

The next morning, they went over their lists.

"I'll start," offered the wife. She took out her list. It had many items on it, in fact, enough to fill 3 pages.

As she started reading the list to her husband, she noticed that tears were starting to appear in her husband's eyes.

"What's wrong?" she asked.

"Nothing, keep reading your list." He replied. The wife continued reading until she had read all three pages.

She neatly placed her list on the table and folded her hands on top of it.

"Now, you read your list and then we can talk about everything on our lists." She said happily.

Quietly the husband stated:"I don't have anything on my list. I think you are perfect the way that you are. You are lovely and wonderful and I wouldn't want to change anything about you."

The wife, touched by his honesty, the depth of his love for her and his acceptance of her, turned her head and wept.

In life, we don't really have to look for things that are disappointing, depressing and annoying. These things will always be there.

Nothing is perfect. However, we can find perfectness in everything by changing the way we see things.
