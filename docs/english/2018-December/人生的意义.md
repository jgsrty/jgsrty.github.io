### Part 1 翻译

#### Life isn't about keeping score. It's not about how many friends you have, or how many people call you, or how accepted or unaccepted you are, not about if you have plans this weekend, or if you're alone. It isn't about who you're dating, who you used to date, how many people you've dated, or if you haven't been with anyone at all. It isn't about who your families are or how much money they have, or what kind of car you drive, or which school you're sent to.

#### It's not about how beautiful or ugly you are, or what clothes you wear, what shoes you have on, or what kind of music you listen to. It's not about if your hair is `blonde`, red, black, brown, or green, or if your skin is too light or too dark.

#### It's not about what grades you get, how smart you are, how smart everyone else thinks you are, or how smart standardize tests say you are, or if this teacher likes you, or if this guy or girl likes you, or what clubs you're in, or how good you are at 'your' sport. It's not about `representing` your whole being on a piece of paper and seeing who will 'accept the written you'.
人生不是一场记分赛，它不在于你拥有多少朋友，有多少人给你打电话，或是有多少人欢迎你或排斥你，不在于你这周末是否有计划安排，或是一个人过。不在于你正和谁约会，曾和谁约会，多少人你约会过，或者从未和别人约会过。不在于你的家人是谁或者他们有多少钱，或者你开什么样的车，上什么学校。

它不在于你有多漂亮或丑陋，穿什么衣服，穿什么鞋子，听什么音乐。它不在于你的头发是金色，红色，黑色，棕色或绿色，或者你的皮肤是白还是黑。

它不在于你得了多少分，你多聪明，别人认为你有多聪明，或者智力测试说你有多聪明，又或者这个老师是否喜欢你，这个男孩或女孩是否喜欢你，或者你在哪个俱乐部，或者你多么擅长某项运动。不在于你在一张纸上的所有表现，并且谁会接受一个纸面上的你。

### Part 2 翻译

#### But life is about whom you love and whom you hurt. It's about whom you make happy or unhappy `purposefully`. It's about keeping or `betraying` trust. It's about friendship, used as `sanctity`, or as a weapon. It's about what you say and mean, maybe hurtful, maybe heartening, about starting `rumors` and contributing to petty `gossip`. It's about what judgments you pass and why, and who your judgments are `spread` to.

#### But most of all, it's about using your life to touch or `poison` other people's hearts in such a way that could never `occurred` alone. Only you choose the way those hearts are affected and those choices are what life is all about.
然而，生命的意义在于你爱谁和伤害了谁。在于你使某人开心或生气。在于保持信赖或背叛信任。在于友谊被当做神圣不可侵犯的，还是一种武器。在于你说了什么，或许很伤人，或许很鼓舞人心，关于散播谣言和助长小道消息。在于你做了什么判断，为什么，这些判断传播给了谁

最重要的是，它在于你用你的生命去触动别人的心灵，还是不发避免的去伤害别人。你选择哪种方式去影响别人的心灵，这些选择将会是你的一生。
