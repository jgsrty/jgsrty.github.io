## 原文阅读

As a kid, I spent my summers with my grandparents on their `ranch` in Texax. I helped fix `windmills`, `vaccinate` cattle, and do other `chores`. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially "Days of our Lives". My grandparents belonged to a `Caravan` Club, a group of Airstream `trailer` owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we'd join the caravan. We'd `hitch` up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips. One one particular trip, I was about 10 years old. Iwas rolling around in the big bench seat in the back of the car. My grandfather was deiving. And my grandmother had the passenger seat. She smoked throughout these trips, and I hated the smell.

At that age, I'd take any `excuse` to make `estimates` and do `minor` `arithmetic`. I'd calculate our gas `mileage`, figure out useless `statistics` on things like `grocery` spending. I'd been hearing an ad `campaign` about smoking. I can't remember the details, but `basically` the ad said, every `puff` of a cigarette takes some number of minutes off of your life. I think it might have been two minutes per puff. At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother. I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on. When I was `satisfied` that I'd come up with a `reasonable` number, I `poked` my head into the front of the car, `tapped` my grandmother on the shoulder, and proudly `proclaimed`, "At two minutes per puff, you've taken nine years off your life!" I have a `vivid` memory of what happened, and it was not what I expected. I expected to be `applauded` for my cleverness and arithmetic skills. "Jeff, you're so smart. You had to have made some `tricky` estimates, figure out the number of minutes in a year and do some `division`." That's not what happened. Instead, my grandmother `burst` into tears. I sat in the backseat and did not know what to do. While my grandmother sat crying, my grandfather, who had been driving in silence, pulled over onto the shoulder of the highway. He got out of the car and came around and opened my door and waited for me to follow. Was I in trouble? My grandfather was a highly `intelligent`, quiet man. He had never said a `harsh` word to me, and maybe this was to be the first time? Or maybe he would ask that I get back in the car and apologize to my grandmother. I had no experience in this `realm` with my grandparents and no way to `gauge` what the `consequences` might be. We stopped beside the trailer. My grandfather looked at me, and after a bit of silence, he gently and calmly said, "Jeff, one day you'll understand that it's harder to be kind than clever."

What I want to talk to you about today is the difference between gifts and choices. Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy, they're given after all. Choices can be hard. You can `seduce` yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the `detriment` of your choices. This is a group with many gifts. I'm sure one of your gifts is the gift of a smart and `capable` brain. I'm confident that's the case bacause admisson is competitve and if there weren't some `signs` that you're clever, the `dean` of admisson wouldn't have let you in.

Your smarts will come in handy because you will travel in a land of `marvels`. We humans -- `plodding` as we are -- will `astonish` ourselves. We'll `invent` ways to `generate` clean energy and a lot of it. Atom by atom, we'll assemble tiny machines that will enter cell walls and make repairs. This month comes the `extraordinary` but also `inevitable` news that we've `synthesized` life. In the coming years, we'll not only synthesize it, but we'll engineer it to `specifications`. I believe you'll even see us understand the human brain. Jules Verne, Mark Twain, Galileo, Newton -- all the `curious` from the ages would have wanted to be alive most of all right now. As a `civilization`, we will have so many gifts, just as you as `individuals` have so many individual gifts as you sit before me. How will you use these gifts? And will you take pride in your gifts or pride in your choices?

I got the idea to start Amazon 16 years ago. I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles -- something that simply couldn't exist in `physical` world -- was very exciting to me. I had just turned 30 years old, and I'd been married for a year. I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most `startups` dont't, and I wasn't sure what would happen after that. MacKenzie (alse a Princeton grad and sitting here in the second row) told me I should go for it. As a young boy, I'd been a `garage` `inventor`. I'd invented an automatic `gate` closer out of cement-filled `tires`, a `solar` cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and `tinfoil`, baking-pan alarms to `entrap` my siblings. I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my `passion`.

I was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people, and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired. I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet. He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said, "That sounds like a really good idea, but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn't already have a good job." That `logic` made some sense to me, and he `convinced` me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision. Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but `ultimately`, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I `suspected` I would always be `haunted` by a decision to not try at all. After much `consideration`, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.

Tomorrow, in a very real sense, your life -- the life you author from `scratch` on your own --begins.
How will you use your gifts? What choices will you make?
Will `inertia` be your guide, or will you follow your passions?
Will you follow `dogma`, or will you be original?
Will you choose a life of ease, or a life of service and adventure?
Will you `wilt` under `criticism`, or will you follow your `convictions`?
Will you `bluff` it out when you're wrong, or will you apologize?
Will you guard your heart `against` rejection, or will you act when you fall in love?
Will you play it safe, or will you be a little bit `swashbuckling`? 
When it's `tough`, will you give up, or will you be `relentless`?
Will you be a `cynic`, or will you be a builder?
Will you be clever at the `expense` of others, or will you be kind?

I will `hazard` a `prediction`. When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection `narrating` for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most `compact` and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story.

Thank you and good luck!
