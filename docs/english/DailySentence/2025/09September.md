## Day 01

#### The First World War began when the archduke of Austria-Hungary was assassinated. 

#### This led to a serious dispute, and soon other countries were involved. Within a few weeks, a war had begun.

#### The people in these countries at first welcomed the news of a war. Many people were intensely patriotic, and supported the war effort without thinking carefully about the reasons for the war.

#### In the western part of Europe, the opposing sides fought many bloody battles. Soldiers on both sides lived in filthy trenches that had been dug out of the ground.

#### The Great Lakes are bordered by the Canadian province of Ontario and by eight U.S. states including (from west to east) Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York.

#### Large cities like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Toronto lie on the shores of the Great Lakes system.

#### Lake Michigan is deeper than Lake Huron, but the latter is larger in area, at 59,600 square kilometers.

#### The Great Lakes, interconnected by rivers, straits, and canals, are a natural resource of tremendous significance in North America; they serve as the focus of the industrial heartland of the continent and together form one of the world's busiest shipping arteries.
