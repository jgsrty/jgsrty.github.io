#### Banff National Park is Canada's oldest and most famous national park. It was founded in 1885 after the discovery of the Cave and Basin Hot Springs. From humble beginnings as a 26 square kilometer hot springs reserve, Banff National Park now consists of 6,641 square kilometers of unparalleled mountain scenery nestled in the heart of the magnificent Canadian Rockies.
 
#### Each year, millions of visitors come to Banff to marvel at the emerald waters of Lake Louise, walk amongst the flower-filled heavens at Sunshine Meadows, and drive beneath the towering jagged peaks lining the Icefields Parkway between Banff and Jasper.

#### Nearly ten millennia later, a struggling nation forged a crazy dream of connecting itself from sea to sea with steel rails, and from this railway venture was born Canada's most famous park, Banff National Park.

#### Banff National Park contains some of the most spectacular mountain scenery in the world. Snow-capped peaks, glistening glaciers, icefields, alpine meadows, blue cold crystal clear lakes, raging rivers, mineral hot springs, deep canyons, hoodoos and sweeping vistas are just one part of the allure of Banff National Park.

#### Lake Louise, with its blue-green water set against the stark backdrop of Victoria Glacier, is the highest permanent settlement in Canada at 1,536 meters (5,039 feet) above the sea level and probably the most beloved and most photographed scene in the Canadian Rockies.

#### Banff National Park is part of the UNESCO Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site.

## Day 01

#### The First World War began when the archduke of Austria-Hungary was assassinated. 

#### This led to a serious dispute, and soon other countries were involved. Within a few weeks, a war had begun.

#### The people in these countries at first welcomed the news of a war. Many people were intensely patriotic, and supported the war effort without thinking carefully about the reasons for the war.

#### In the western part of Europe, the opposing sides fought many bloody battles. Soldiers on both sides lived in filthy trenches that had been dug out of the ground.

#### The Great Lakes are bordered by the Canadian province of Ontario and by eight U.S. states including (from west to east) Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York.

#### Large cities like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Toronto lie on the shores of the Great Lakes system.

#### Lake Michigan is deeper than Lake Huron, but the latter is larger in area, at 59,600 square kilometers.

#### The Great Lakes, interconnected by rivers, straits, and canals, are a natural resource of tremendous significance in North America; they serve as the focus of the industrial heartland of the continent and together form one of the world's busiest shipping arteries.
