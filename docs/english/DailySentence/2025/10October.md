#### Scientists do not talk very much to literary men and vice versa. Neither group seems to know, or want to know, very much about the other. Few scientists or engineers read literature; very few writers or intellectuals know or care anything about science.

#### Literary culture seems to be anti-science and anti-technology. This affects Western reluctance to train more scientists and engineers. Nonetheless, relatively little effort is given to encouraging and developing these areas of education.

#### Westerners, who are part of the literary culture, do not encourage or understand the scientific revolution. As a result, they are insensitive to the desire of Third World peoples to improve their lives through technology.

#### In 1800, only a small portion of society could expect to live well. 

#### Snow agrees that most scientists and engineers do not read novels or cultivate the arts. However, he doesn't consider this to be as dangerous as when literary people ignore science and technology. Science and technology are too important to our standard of living to be ignored; our education systems have to be changed to reflect our need of them.

#### Snow's article was quite controversial. Not everyone agreed with him that science and technology are being ignored by our educational system.
