## Day 15
#### When someone dies, arrangements are made with a funeral home to get the body and prepare it for burial. Funeral homes are private businesses. They usually handle most or all aspects of a funeral, except for providing the burial plot. That usually has to be purchased separately. Old roomy private homes and new modern one-level buildings are common types.

#### When the funeral director receives the body, his staff embalms it so it will not decay quickly and will look lifelike at the funeral service. The deceased person is usually dressed in their best clothes, and lying on their back in a coffin. Members of the dead person's immediate family usually act as hosts for the funeral home visitation. They greet the mourners and talk to them about the deceased.

#### Usually the mourners are asked to sign a guest book. Frequently, however, the service is held at a chapel at the funeral home. A minister or priest usually conducts the funeral service. There will be hymns, prayers, and perhaps a sermon, like a regular church service. 

#### At the end of the service, the coffin is wheeled out to a waiting car, called a hearse, which drives the dead person to the burial place. The mourners go to their cars and follow the hearse to the cemetery. At the cemetery, a hole has already been dug to receive the coffin. Usually there's a short ceremony at the grave. A handful of soil is tossed on the coffin, indicating burial.

#### Sometimes, the deceased will be placed in an expensive rental coffin for the visitation and funeral, but buried in a less expensive coffin. Even so, a full funeral rarely costs less than $5,000, and is usually quite a lot more. This does not include the price of the burial plot or the stone grave marker. Sometimes poor people are buried at government expense.

#### The advantage of cremation is that it is less expensive, uses less land, and it appeals to people who don't want an elaborate funeral.

#### They are a way of saying goodbye to the dead person and receiving mutual support and encouragement from friends and family. Some funeral homes help to organize grief counselling or support groups to grieving family members. Usually the funeral service is performed in the Christian tradition and refers to the hope of resurrection or rebirth from the dead that Christians believe in.

#### It is now becoming common for people to plan their own funeral service before they die. And usually attempts are made to make the service appropriate to the person who died. This makes it more satisfying and memorable for family and friends.




## Day 14
#### Scientists do not talk very much to literary men and vice versa. Neither group seems to know, or want to know, very much about the other. Few scientists or engineers read literature; very few writers or intellectuals know or care anything about science.

#### Literary culture seems to be anti-science and anti-technology. This affects Western reluctance to train more scientists and engineers. Nonetheless, relatively little effort is given to encouraging and developing these areas of education.

#### Westerners, who are part of the literary culture, do not encourage or understand the scientific revolution. As a result, they are insensitive to the desire of Third World peoples to improve their lives through technology.

#### In 1800, only a small portion of society could expect to live well. 

#### Snow agrees that most scientists and engineers do not read novels or cultivate the arts. However, he doesn't consider this to be as dangerous as when literary people ignore science and technology. Science and technology are too important to our standard of living to be ignored; our education systems have to be changed to reflect our need of them.

#### Snow's article was quite controversial. Not everyone agreed with him that science and technology are being ignored by our educational system.
