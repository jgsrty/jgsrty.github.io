# 教育的意义
### The Importance of Education
>爱阅读-Iris Murdoch

### 翻译
#### Education doesn't make you happy, and nor does freedom.
教育不能让你感到快乐，也不能让你感到自由。

#### We don't become happy just because we're free - if we are. Or because we've been educated - if we have. But because education may be the means by which we realize we are happy.
我们不会因为自由而感到快乐-如果有自由的话，也不会因为教育感到快乐-如果受到过教育。但教育或许能让我们意识到快乐的方法。

#### It opens our eyes, our ears, tells us where delights are `lurking`, `convinces` us that there is only one freedom of any importance whatsoever, that of the mind, and gives us the `assurance` - the confidence - to walk the path our mind, our educated mind, offers.
教育开阔了我们的视野，丰富我们的听觉，告诉我们快乐藏在哪里，让我们相信只有一种自由是无比重要的，那就是我们思想，给了我们无比的自信，让我们走在受过教育的思想子路上。

## 原文阅读
Education doesn't make you happy, and nor does freedom.

We don't become happy just because we're free - if we are. Or because we've been educated - if we have. But because education may be the means by which we realize we are happy.

It opens our eyes, our ears, tells us where delights are lurking, convinces us that there is only one freedom of any importance whatsoever, that of the mind, and gives us the assurance - the confidence - to walk the path our mind, our educated mind, offers.
