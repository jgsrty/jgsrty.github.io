### The Value of Reading

## 翻译

#### You do not need to read a book for the book's `sake`, but for your own.
不能为了读书而读书，而是为你自己。
#### You may read because in your high-pressure life, studded with problems and emergencies, you need `periods` of `relief` and yet recognize that peace of mind dose not mean `numbness` of mind.
你看书可能是因为你在高压而又充满问题和紧急情况的生活中，你需要片刻放松，也意识到内心平静并不意味着头脑麻木。
#### You may read because you never had an opportunity to go to college, and books give you a chance to get something you missed.

#### You may read because you are tired of the `shallowness` of `contemporary` life, bored by the current conversational `commonplaces`, and `wearied` of shop talk and gossip about people.
你看书可能是因为你厌倦了当代生活的浅薄，厌倦了时下的日常寒暄，厌倦了商店力闲言碎语和他人的蜚语流言。
#### Whatever your `dominant` personal reason, you will find that reading gives knowledge, creative power, satisfaction and relaxation.
无论你看书的主要原因是什么，你会发现阅读会带给你知识、创造力、满足感和放松。

#### Books are a source of pleasure -- the purest and the most lasting.
书是快乐的源泉——最为纯洁、最为持久。

书籍增强了你对生活乐趣的感知。
#### Reading them is not a violent pleasure like the `gross` enjoyment of an uncultivated mind, but a `subtle` delight.
阅读书籍不像粗野之人享受那种强烈的快乐，而是一种微妙的喜悦。
#### Reading `dispels` prejudices which `hem` our minds within narrow spaces.
阅读能消除把我们禁锢在狭小空间里的偏见。
#### One of the things that will surprise you as you read good books from all over the world and from all times of man is that human nature is much the same today as it has been ever since writing began to tell us about it.
那就是人类本性从写作最初讲述它的那天起，到今天为止，几乎一直没变。
#### Some people act as if it were `demeaning` to them to wish to be well-read, but you can no more be a healthy person mentally without reading `substantial` books than you can be a vigorous person physically without eating solid food.
有些人表现的好像博览群书是对他的贬低，但如果你没有阅读过大量书籍就无法成为精神上健康的人，就像你不吃食物就无法精力充沛一样。
