# 全神贯注的观察

### Look with Intensity

## 翻译

#### It seems to me that learning is `astonishingly` difficult, as is listening also.
对我而言，学习是一件无比困难的事，聆听也一样。
#### We never actually listen to anything because our mind is not free, our ears are stuffed up with those things that we already know, so listening becomes `extraordinarily` difficult.
我们从未真的倾听过任何事，因为我们的记忆没有空余，我们的耳朵塞满了已知的事物。因此聆听变成了一件尤为困难的事。
#### I think -- or rather, it is a fact -- that if one can listen to something with all of one's being, with vigor, with `vitality`, then the very act of listening is a `liberative` factor, but unfortunately you never do listen, as you have never learned about it.
我想——或者说这就是事实——如果有人可以用所有的生命、精力和活力去倾听，那么这种行为就是一种因素的释放，但很不幸的是，你从来没有认真聆听，因此你从未真正投入过。
#### After all, you only learn when you give your whole being to something.
归根结底，你只有把全部的生命投入进去在某事某物上，你才真正了解它。
#### When you give your whole being to mathematics, you learn.
当你全身心的投入到数学上，你才能学到。
#### But when you are in a state of contradiction, when you do not want to learn but are forced to learn, then it become merely a process of accumulation.
但如果你处于一种矛盾的状态中，当你不想学习，但是却被迫要学，那它就仅仅是一个累积知识的过程。
#### To learn is like reading a novel with innumerable characters, it requires your full attention, not contradictory attention.
学习如同读一本数不清字数的小说，它需要你的全神贯注，而不是自相矛盾。
#### If you want to learn about a leaf -- a leaf of the spring or a leaf of summer -- you must really look at it, see the `symmetry` of it, the texture of it, the quality of the living leaf.
如果你想了解一片树叶——春天或者夏天的树叶——你必须认真的观察它，看它对称的外形，它的质地，以及鲜活绿叶的特点。
#### There is beauty, there is vigor, there is vitality in a single leaf.
这一篇绿叶中蕴含了美、精力和活力。
#### So to learn about the leaf, the flower, the cloud, the sunset, or a human being, you must look with all intensity.
因此，若想了解一片树叶、一朵花、一片云、落日或一个人，你必须要全神贯注的观察。

## 原文阅读

It seems to me that learning is astonishingly diffcult, as is listening also.

We never actually listen to anything because our mind is not free, our ears are stuffed up with those things that we already know, so listening becomes extraordinarily difficult.

I think -- or rather, it is a fact -- that if one can listen to something with all of one's being, with vigor, with vitality, then the very act of listening is a liberative factor, but unfortunately you never do listen, as you have never learned about it.

After all, you only learn when you give your whole being to something.

When you give your whole being to mathematics, you learn.

But when you are in a state of contradiction, when you do not want to learn but are forced to learn, then it become merely a process of accumulation.

To learn is like reading a novel with innumerable characters, it requires your full attention, not contradictory attention.

If you want to learn about a leaf -- a leaf of the spring or a leaf of summer -- you must really look at it, see the symmetry of it, the texture of it, the quality of the living leaf.

There is beauty, there is vigor, there is vitality in a single leaf.

So to learn about the leaf, the flower, the cloud, the sunset, or a human being, you must look with all intensity.
