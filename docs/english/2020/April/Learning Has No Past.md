#### What it is doing is this: it is gathering to itself information, experience as knowledge, and from the background of what it has gathered, it experiences, it learns; and therefore it is never really learning, but always knowing, acquiring.
它所做的是：收集信息和经验性的知识，在这样的背景下经历事物，同样也在学习；因此它不必真的学习，但总在不断的知晓、获取。

#### I have to know myself, the structure, the nature, the significance of the total entity; but I can't do that burdened with my previous knowledge, with my previous experience, or with a mind that is conditioned, for then I am not learning, I am merely interpreting, translating, looking with an eye that is already clouded by the past.
我必须了解自己，了解个体存在的构造、本质和意义；但我不能背负着以往的知识、经验以及调整好的思维方式，那样依赖我就不是在学习，而是在解释、翻译，用已经被过去蒙上了一层雾的眼睛在观察。

## 原文阅读

Wisdom is something that has to be discovered by each one, and it is not the result of knowledge.

Knowledge and wisdom do not go together.

Wisdom comes when there is maturity of self-knowing.

Without knowing oneself, order is not possible, and therefore there is no virtue.

Now, learning about oneself, and accumulating knowledge about oneself, are two different things...

A mind that is acquiring knowledge is never learning.

What it is doing is this: it is gathering to itself information, experience as knowledge, and from the background of what it has gathered, it experiences, it learns; and therefore it is never really learning, but always knowing, acquiring.

Learning is always in the active present; it has no past.

The moment you say to yourself, "I have learned," it has already become knowledge, and from the background of that knowledge you can accumulate, translate, but you cannot further learn.

It is only a mind that is not acquiring, but always learning - it is only such a mind that can understand this whole entity that we call the "me," the self.

I have to know myself, the structure, the nature, the significance of the total entity; but I can't do that burdened with my previous knowledge, with my previous experience, or with a mind that is conditioned, for then I am not learning, I am merely interpreting, translating, looking with an eye that is already clouded by the past.
