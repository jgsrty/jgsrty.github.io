When was the last time you washed your hands? Did you know that nearly 80% of infectious diseases are spread by contacting things around you? We touch money and door handles, we share pens to sign documents in banks and what not. Oh, and we love shaking hands. That's just gross. It's not surprising that washing your hands with soap is the number one preventative measure against viruses. But what if you ignored your hand hygiene for a year? How many different germs would make your palms their home? And how could you alone cause the worldwide economic crisis? This is what is and here's what would happen if you didn't wash your hands for a year.

Everyone knows we have to wash our hands with soap. But the reality is, most of us are either doing it wrong or aren't doing it at all. Let me show you what happens when you grow your hand bacteria in petri dishes. This squeaky clean sample is after a full 20-second hand wash with soap. This sample has the bacteria that's left when you just rinse your hands with water. And this one shows how much bacteria lives on your hands when you don't wash them.

Now, are you ready for some gross stats? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, found that 69% of men and 35% of women don't wash their hands after using a public bathroom. And 93% of people don't wash their hands after coughing or sneezing. Okay, I'm gonna wash my hands right now. Where were we? Ah, not washing your hands for a year. I hope our research team didn't test this one on themselves.

Alright, here are the ground rules. Let's assume that, hypothetically, your hands didn't touch soap or hand sanitizer for 12 months. You could still swim and shower, or get your hands wet in the rain, but you didn't wash them. How soon will you become a walking bacteria stick?

Unfortunately, I can't give you an exact timeline here. It depends on too many factors, like the types of germs, and how many people you come in contact with. And it looks like we didn't sacrifice our researchers for that purpose. The only certainty is that you would get sick. When? soon enough.

In the short term, your hands would start to look aesthetically displeasing. They'd be covered in dirt and grease, and plethora of unseen bacteria. People would stop shaking your hands, and I wouldn't even give you an elbow bump. But the unpleasant look of your hands would be the least of your problems.

According to research from the University of Colorado, our hands carry some 3,200 bacteria from 150 different species. Every time you used the toilet, the number of germs on your fingertips would double. That has something to do with the fact that germs can spray up to 2m in the air when you flush. You'd transfer all those bacteria to your food and drinks. And that would be making you repeatedly sick. You'd be having 30% more diarrhea-related illnesses, and 20% more respiratory infections like flu. Your doctor would keep prescribing antibiotics. Eventually, the bacteria on your hands would develop resistance to those meds, and they would stop helping you.

If that's not bad enough, you'd make others sick as well. And if everyone got sick, they'd have to take time off work and lock themselves at home. When people stay home and don't get out to restaurants or shopping malls, the economy takes a nosedive. If a pandemic spreads all over the world, the economic slowdown could cost trillions of dollars.

Bottom line, not washing your hands for a year isn't something you want to try, but if you do, make sure to practice social distancing, so you don't come in contact with too many people and cause another pandemic. Washing hands helps save lives, it's the best method for removing hand bacteria and stopping the spread of viruses.

Here's how to do it right. Wet your hands with clean water. Turn off the tap, and apply soap. Keep lathering your hands for at least 20 seconds. You can hum a verse of your favorite song twice, or just watch this video from this point and still the end. Make sure to wash between your fingers, under your nails, and the back of your hands. Rinse your hands with water and dry them with a clean towel. Do it regularly and stay safe.

#### When was the last time you washed your hands? Did you know that nearly 80% of infectious diseases are spread by contacting things around you? We touch money and door handles, we share pens to sign documents in banks and what not. Oh, and we love shaking hands. That's just gross. It's not surprising that washing your hands with soap is the number one preventative measure against viruses. But what if you ignored your hand `hygiene` for a year? How many different germs would make your palms their home? And how could you alone cause the worldwide economic crisis? This is what is and here's what would happen if you didn't wash your hands for a year.
你最后一次洗手是什么时候？你知道80%的传染病是通过接触你周围的东西传播的吗？我们摸钱和门把手，在银行共用笔签文件等等。对了，我们还喜欢握手，这真是恶心。毫不奇怪，用肥皂洗手是预防病毒的首要措施。但如果你一年都忽略手部卫生怎么办？有多少细菌会让你的手掌成为它们的家？你一个人又怎样造成全球经济危机？以下就是如果你一年不洗手会发生的事。
#### Everyone knows we have to wash our hands with soap. But the reality is, most of us are either doing it wrong or aren't doing it at all. Let me show you what happens when you grow your hand bacteria in `petri dishes`. This squeaky clean sample is after a full 20-second hand wash with soap. This sample has the bacteria that's left when you just rinse your hands with water. And this one shows how much bacteria lives on your hands when you don't wash them.
每个人都知道我们必须用肥皂洗手。但现实是，我们大多数人要么做错了，要么根本就没做。让我向你们展示当你在培养皿中培养手上的细菌会发生什么。这个干净的样品用肥皂整整洗了20秒。这个样本是仅仅用水洗手后留下的细菌。最后一个样本是没有洗手时手上的细菌。
##### Now, are you ready for some gross stats? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, found that 69% of men and 35% of women don't wash their hands after using a public bathroom. And 93% of people don't wash their hands after coughing or sneezing. Okay, I'm gonna wash my hands right now. Where were we? Ah, not washing your hands for a year. I hope our research team didn't test this one on themselves.
现在，你准备好接受一些总数居了吗？美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）发现，69%的男性和35%的女性在使用公共厕所后不洗手。93%的人在咳嗽或打喷嚏后不洗手。好吧，我现在要洗手。我们在干什么？一年不洗手。我希望我们的研究小组没有在他们自己身上测试这个。
#### Alright, here are the ground rules. Let's assume that, `hypothetically`, your hands didn't touch soap or hand `sanitizer` for 12 months. You could still swim and shower, or get your hands wet in the rain, but you didn't wash them. How soon will you become a walking bacteria stick?
这里有一些基本规则。我们假设你的手12个月没碰触过肥皂或洗手液。但你仍可以游泳、淋雨或者下雨时把手淋湿，但你没有清洗它们。你需要多久会变成一个行走的细菌人？
#### Unfortunately, I can't give you an exact timeline here. It depends on too many factors, like the types of germs, and how many people you come in contact with. And it looks like we didn't `sacrifice` our researchers for that purpose. The only certainty is that you would get sick. When? soon enough.
不幸的是，我不能给你一个确切的时间。这取决于很多因素，比如细菌的类型以级你接触过多少人。我们并不会为了这个目的牺牲我们的研究人员。唯一确定的时你会生病。至于什么时候？很快就对了。
#### In the short term, your hands would start to look `aesthetically` displeasing. They'd be covered in dirt and `grease`, and `plethora` of unseen bacteria. People would stop shaking your hands, and I wouldn't even give you an elbow bump. But the unpleasant look of your hands would be the least of your problems.
从短期来看，你的手会开始看起来不美观。它们会被污垢和油脂覆盖，还有大量看不见的细菌。人们会拒绝和你握手，我甚至都不会碰你的手肘。但这种情况只是你最小的问题。
#### According to research from the University of Colorado, our hands carry some 3,200 bacteria from 150 different species. Every time you used the toilet, the number of germs on your fingertips would double. That has something to do with the fact that germs can spray up to 2m in the air when you flush. You'd transfer all those bacteria to your food and drinks. And that would be making you repeatedly sick. You'd be having 30% more `diarrhea`-related illnesses, and 20% more `respiratory` infections like flu. Your doctor would keep prescribing `antibiotics`. Eventually, the bacteria on your hands would develop resistance to those meds, and they would stop helping you.
根据科罗拉多大学的研究，我们的手携带者来自150多种的大约3200个细菌。你每次上厕所指尖上的细菌数量就会翻倍。这与当你冲水时，细菌可以上升2米的高度有关。你会把这些细菌转移到你的食物和饮料上。这会让你反复生病。你会有30%的概率得腹泻相关的疾病，20%得概率得流感这样的呼吸道疾病。你的医生会一直开抗生素。最终，你手上得细菌会对这些药物产生抗药性，这些药物会停止对你身体的帮助。
#### If that's not bad enough, you'd make others sick as well. And if everyone got sick, they'd have to take time off work and lock themselves at home. When people stay home and don't get out to restaurants or shopping malls, the economy takes a `nosedive`. If a pandemic spreads all over the world, the economic slowdown could cost trillions of dollars.
如果这还不够糟的话，你还会让别人生病。如果每个人都生病了，他们不得不请假，把自己锁在家里。如果人们都呆在家里，不出去下馆子或购物，经济就会一落千丈。如果疫情蔓延至世界各地，经济放缓将会导致数万亿美元的损失。
#### Bottom line, not washing your hands for a year isn't something you want to try, but if you do, make sure to practice social distancing, so you don't come in contact with too many people and cause another pandemic. Washing hands helps save lives, it's the best method for removing hand bacteria and stopping the spread of viruses.
最后我想说的是，一年不洗手并不是你想尝试的事，但如果你这么做了，请保持社交距离。这样你就不会接触太多人，从而引发另一场流行病。洗手可以拯救生命，这是去除受伤细菌和组织病毒传播的最好办法。
#### Here's how to do it right. Wet your hands with clean water. Turn off the tap, and apply soap. Keep lathering your hands for at least 20 seconds. You can hum a verse of your favorite song twice, or just watch this video from this point and still the end. Make sure to wash between your fingers, under your nails, and the back of your hands. Rinse your hands with water and dry them with a clean towel. Do it regularly and stay safe.
以下是正确的做法。先用清水打湿手，关上水龙头，涂上肥皂。保持双手冲水20秒以。你可以哼两遍你最喜欢的曲子，或者就从这里看视频直到结束。确保你的手指间、指甲下面和手背都洗干净。再用清水冲洗双手，并用干净的毛巾擦干。保持这样做保持安全。
