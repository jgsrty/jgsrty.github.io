<p>Once upon a younger year</p>
<p>When all our shadows disappeared</p>
<p>The animals inside came out to play</p>
<p>When face to face with all our fears</p>
<p>Learned our lessons through the tears</p>
<p>Made memories we knew would never fade</p>
<p>One day my father, he told me son don't let it slip away</p>
<p>He took me in his arms, I heard him say</p>
<p>When you get older, your wild life will live for younger days</p>
<p>Think of me if ever you're afraid</p>
<p>He said one day, you'll leave this world behind</p>
<p>So live a life you will remember</p>
<p>My father told me when I was just a child</p>
<p>These are the nights that never die</p>
<p>My father told me</p>
<p>When thunderclouds start pouring down</p>
<p>Light a fire they can't put out</p>
<p>Carve you name into the shining stars</p>
<p>He said go venture far beyound the shores</p>
<p>Don't forsake this life of yours</p>
<p>I guide you home no matter where you are</p>
<p>One day my father, he told me son don't let it slip away</p>
<p>When I was just a kid I heard him say</p>
<p>When you get older, your wild life will live for younger day</p>
<p>Think of me if ever you're afraid</p>
