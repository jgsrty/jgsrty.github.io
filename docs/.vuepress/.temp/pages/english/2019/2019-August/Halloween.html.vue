<p>Halloween falls on October 31 each year in Britain, North America and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Like many other holidays, Halloween has evolved and changed throughout history and is a mix of pagan and Christian tradition.</p>
<p>Over 2000 years ago, people called the Celts lived in what is now Ireland and parts of northern France.</p>
<p>November 1 was then New Year's Day, and they believed that the night before the new year, on October 31, was a time when the living and the dead came together.</p>
<p>More than 1000 years ago, the Christian church named November 1 All Saint's Day, also called All Hallows.</p>
<p>This was a special holy day to honor the Saints and other people who died for their religion.</p>
<p>The night before All Hallows was called Hallows Eve.</p>
<p>Later the name was changed to Halloween.</p>
<p>Like the Celts, the Europeans at that time also believed that the spirits of the dead would visit the earth on Halloween.</p>
<p>They worried that evil spirits would cause problems or hurt them.</p>
<p>So on that night, people wore costumes that look like ghosts or other evil creatures.</p>
<p>They thought if they dress like that, the spirits would think they were also dead and not harm them.</p>
<p>The tradition of Halloween was carried to America by the immigrating Europeans.</p>
<p>Some of the customs changed a little though.</p>
<p>For example, on Halloween in Europe some people would carry lanterns made from turnips.</p>
<p>In America pumpkins were more common. So people become putting candles inside them and using them as lanterns.</p>
<p>That is why you see Jack-o-lanterns today.</p>
<p>These days Halloween is not usually considered a religious holiday. It is primarily a fun day for children.</p>
<p>Children dress up in costumes like people did 1000 years ago.</p>
<p>But instead of worrying about evil spirits, they go from house to house asking for treats.</p>
<p>They knock on the doors and say 'trick or treat'; the owner of each house gives candy or something special to each trick-or-treater.</p>
<p>If they don't, they may be on the receiving end of a prank.</p>
