<p>When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before:&quot;Be more confident.&quot;</p>
<p>And most likely, this is what you think when hou hear it:&quot;If only it were that simple.&quot;</p>
<p>But what is confidence?</p>
<p>Take the belief that you are valuable, worthwhile, and capable, also know as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously to face a challenge haed-on.</p>
<p>This is confidence. It turns thoughts into action.</p>
<p>So where dose confidence even come from?</p>
<p>There are several factors that impact confidence.</p>
<p>One: what you're born with, such as your genes, which will impact things like the balance of neurochemicals in your brain.</p>
<p>Two: how you're treated. This includes the social pressures of your enviroment.</p>
<p>And three: the part hou have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about and respond to challenges and setbacks.</p>
<p>It isn't possible to completely untangle these three factors, but the personal choices we make certainly play a major role in confidence development.</p>
<p>So, by keeping in mind a few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate our own confidence.</p>
<p>Tip 1: a quick fix.</p>
<p>There are a few tricks that can give you an immediate confidence boost in the short time.</p>
<p>Picture your success when you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music with deep bass; it can promote feeling of power.</p>
<p>You can even strike a powerful pose give yourself a pep talk.</p>
<p>Tip two: believe in your ability to improve.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think about your abilities and talents.</p>
<p>Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed, like a muscle?</p>
<p>These beliefs matter because they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks.</p>
<p>If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents are locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered something you're not very good at.</p>
<p>But if you have a growth mindset and think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
<p>Neuroscience supports the growth mindset.</p>
<p>The connections in your brain do get stronger and grow with study and practice.</p>
<p>It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset are more successful, getting better grades, and doing better in the face of challenges.</p>
<p>Tip three: practice failure.</p>
<p>Face it, you're going to fail sometimes. Everyone dose.</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling was rejected by twelve different publishers before one picked up &quot;Harry Potter.&quot;</p>
