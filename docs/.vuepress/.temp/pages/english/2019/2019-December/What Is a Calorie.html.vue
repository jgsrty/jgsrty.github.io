<p>我们时常听到卡路里这个词。人们常常会问：这块饼干有多少卡路里？</p>

<p>做100下开合跳、长跑、或是动动身体可以燃烧多少卡路里？</p>

<p>但到底什么才是卡路里？我们到底需要多少卡路里？</p>

<p>卡路里是一种追踪身体热量消耗与摄取的方式。</p>

<p>当我们摄取的卡路里与我们消耗的量相同时，身体就达到平衡。</p>
<h4 id="if-we-consistently-put-more-energy-into-our-bodies-than-we-burn-the-excess-will-gradually-be-stored-as-fat-in-our-cells-and-we-ll-gain-weight" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#if-we-consistently-put-more-energy-into-our-bodies-than-we-burn-the-excess-will-gradually-be-stored-as-fat-in-our-cells-and-we-ll-gain-weight" aria-hidden="true">#</a> If we consistently put more energy into our bodies than we burn, the <code v-pre>excess</code> will gradually be stored as fat in our cells, and we'll gain weight.</h4>
<p>如果我们长时间摄入过量的能量，则会变成脂肪储存在我们的细胞里，我们的体重也会因此增加。</p>
<h4 id="if-we-burn-off-more-energy-than-we-replenish-we-ll-lose-weight" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#if-we-burn-off-more-energy-than-we-replenish-we-ll-lose-weight" aria-hidden="true">#</a> If we burn off more energy than we replenish, we'll lose weight.</h4>
<p>如果我们消耗的热量大于摄取的量，我们就会变瘦。</p>

<p>所以，我们必须知道如何计算我们摄取和消耗的热量，于是我们用一个叫卡路里的单位计算。</p>
<h4 id="one-calorie-the-kind-we-mesure-in-food-also-called-a-large-calorie-is-defined-as-the-amount-of-energy-it-would-take-to-raise-the-temperature-of-one-kilogram-of-water-by-one-degree-celsius" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#one-calorie-the-kind-we-mesure-in-food-also-called-a-large-calorie-is-defined-as-the-amount-of-energy-it-would-take-to-raise-the-temperature-of-one-kilogram-of-water-by-one-degree-celsius" aria-hidden="true">#</a> One calorie, the kind we mesure in food, also called a large calorie, is defined as the amount of energy it would take to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.</h4>
<p>卡路里是我们用来计算食物热量的单位，也称一大卡，其定义是可以将一公斤的水加热一摄氏度的热量。</p>

<p>而我们吃的每样东西都有它的卡路里总量，它含有多少能量都储存在食物的化学键中。</p>

<p>这些能量用在三个地方：约10%被用来进行消化作用，约20%用作身体的各项运动，而最大的部分，约79%的能量负责支撑我们身体器官和组织功能的运作。</p>

<p>并非如此。</p>

<p>We hear about calories all the time. How many calories are in this cookie?</p>
<p>How many are burned by 100 jumping jacks, or long distance running, or fidgeting?</p>
<p>But what is a calorie, really, and how many of them do we actually need?</p>
<p>Calories are a way of keeping track of the body's energy budget.</p>
<p>A healthy balance occurs when we put in about as much energy as we lose.</p>
<p>If we consistently put more energy into our bodies than we burn, the excess will gradually be stored as fat in our cells, and we'll gain weight.</p>
<p>If we burn off more energy than we replenish, we'll lose weight.</p>
<p>So we have to be able to measure the energy we consume and use, and we do so with a unit called the calorie.</p>
<p>One calorie, the kind we measure in food, also called a large calorie, is defined as the amount of energy it would take to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.</p>
<p>Everything we consume has a calorie count, a measure of how much energy the item stores in its chemical bonds.</p>
<p>The average pizza slice has 272 calories, there are about 78 in a piece of bread, and an apple has about 52.</p>
<p>That energy is released during digestion, and stored in other molecules that can be broken down to provide energy when the body needs it.</p>
<p>It's used in three ways: about 10% enables digestion, about 20% fuels physical activity, and the biggest chunk, around 70%, supports the basic functions of our organs and tissues.</p>
<p>That third usage corresponds to your basal metabolic rate, a number of calories you would need to survive if you weren't eating or moving around.</p>
<p>Add in some physical activity and digestion, and you arrive at the official guidelines for how many calories the average person requires each day: 2000 for women and 2500 for men.</p>
<p>Those estimates are based on factors like average weight, physical activity and muscle mass.</p>
<p>So dose that mean everyone should shoot for around 2000 calories?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>If you're doing an energy guzzling activity, like cycling the Tour de France, your body could use up to 9000 calories per day.</p>
<p>Pregnancy requires slightly more calories than usual, and elderly people typically have a slower metabolic rate, energy is burned more gradually, so less is needed.</p>
<p>Here's something else you should know before you start counting calories.</p>
<p>The calories counts on nutrition labels measure how much energy the food contains, not how much energy you can actually get out of it.</p>
<p>Fibrous foods like celery and whole wheat take more energy to digest, so you'd actually wind up with less energy from a 100 calorie serving of celery than a 100 calorie serving of potato chips.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that some foods offer nutrients like protein and vitamins, while others provide far less nutritional value.</p>
<p>Eating too many of those foods could leave you overwieght and malnourished.</p>
<p>And even with the exact food, different people might not get the same number of calories.</p>
<p>Variations in things like enzyme levels, gut bacteria, and even intestine length, means that every individual's ability to extract energy from food is a little different.</p>
<p>So a caloire is a useful energy measure, but to work out exactly how many of them each of us requires we need to factor in things like exercise, food type, and our body's ability to process energy.</p>
<p>Good luck finding all of that on a nutrition label.</p>
