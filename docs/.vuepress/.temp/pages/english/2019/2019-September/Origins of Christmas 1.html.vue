<p>Christmas is the most widely celebrated holiday in the world today.</p>
<p>But how long has Christmas been around? And has it always been celebrated the same way?</p>
<p>For hundreds of years, many different cultures across Europe celebrated a yearly festival on December 21.</p>
<p>This day is known as the Winter Solstice.</p>
<p>This is a significant day because it is the shortest day of the year, meaning that this day has the least amount of time between sunup and sundown.</p>
<p>In ancient Rome, there were multiple celebrations associated with the solstice.</p>
<p>One of those celebrations was known as Saturnalia.</p>
<p>Saturnalia was a holiday honoring Saturn, the Roman god of agriculture.</p>
<p>The holiday began on December 17 and continued through December 23.</p>
<p>Saturnalia was a festive time when food and drink were plentiful.</p>
<p>During this reason of fun, the normal social order would reverse, and the wealthy would turn control of the city over to the poor.</p>
<p>Businesses and schools would even close during the celebration, so that everyone could indulge in the frivolity.</p>
<p>In Germany and regions further north, the Winter Solstice celebration was knwon as Yule.</p>
<p>During the Yule celebration, families would find the biggest log they could and bring it inside.</p>
<p>They would burn the log on their fireplace and attempt to keep the fire going for 12 days.</p>
<p>During the time the Yule log burned, there would be many days of festivities and revelry.</p>
<p>Yule wasn't an important holiday, because this was the time of years when animals were slaughtered.</p>
<p>And this was the only time of year when most people had fresh meat.</p>
<p>As part of the celebration, families would bring an evergreen tree into the home and decorate it.</p>
<p>The evergreen tree was the only type of tree that would stay green throughout the winter.</p>
<p>Therefore they viewed it as a symbol of continued life.</p>
<p>They also told stories of a mythical being, Odin, who flew through the sky during Yule to leave presents and sweets for children.</p>
<p>They also believed Odin would determine who would prosper and who would fail in the coming year.</p>
<p>These Winter Solstice traditions and many others helped lay the foundations for what would some day become Christmas.</p>
