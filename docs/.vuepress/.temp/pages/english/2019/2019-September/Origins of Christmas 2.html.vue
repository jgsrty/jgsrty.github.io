<p>The Winter Solstice celebrations of Saturnalia and Yule predated Christmas.</p>
<p>So when did Christmas actually become &quot;Christmas&quot;?</p>
<p>Sometime during the fourth century, the Roman Catholic Church made the decision to acknowledge the date of December 25 as the birthday of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The actual date of Jesus birth was unknown, yet Christians longed for a day on which they could celebrate.</p>
<p>The Church chose this late December day because of the already existing Winter Solstice celebrations, that most cultures were accustomed to recognizing during that portion of the year.</p>
<p>Throughout the Middle Ages, churches across Europe began holding special services known as a Mass on December 25.</p>
<p>These services became known as Christ Mass, which eventually led to the modern name of holiday &quot;Christmas&quot;.</p>
<p>However, most of us would not recognize a Christmas celebration from the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Christmas was a spirited time full of mischief and hijinks.</p>
<p>Merry revelers would visit the homes of the wealthy, where they would bang on their doors and demand entry.</p>
<p>Once inside, they would refuse to leave until they were served the best food and drink.</p>
<p>If the homeowner refused, the visitors were threatened to play a trick or a prank.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, in 1652, Christmas was actually outlawed in England and the New England colonies, partially because some thought it was too wild amongst many other reasons.</p>
<p>Businesses were even forced to stay open on Christmas day.</p>
<p>However, people refused to stop celebrating.</p>
<p>They simply hid their festivities from their authorities.</p>
<p>In 1656, Christmas was restored as a legal holiday.</p>
<p>In the late 1700s, in America, Christmas was viewed as an English holiday.</p>
<p>And since the Americans had just fought the revolutionary war against the English, they wanted no part of such a holiday.</p>
<p>Therefore, for many years, December 25 was just another day in America.</p>
<p>Finally, sometimes around the 1820s, Christmas began the process of taking on its modern shape.</p>
<p>As more and more Americans began celebrating the holiday, traditions began to emerge and spread from place to place.</p>
<p>Eventually, Christmas would become the holiday that we all know and love.</p>
