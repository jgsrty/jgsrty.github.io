<p>我昨天读了一篇研究，上面显示在去年，我们中有一半的选择不休假。</p>

Times we could be on the beach buried in sand or traveling the earth, we spend it in the office, traveling from desk to desk, buried in paperwork.</h4>
<p>问题是：你不觉得这么多人在不需要上班的时候还继续工作很疯狂吗？我们把本可以呆在沙滩上埋在沙里或环游世界的时间，消耗在了办公室里，在办公桌之间旅行，埋头于文书工作。</p>

<p>看，在这个混乱的世界上，一切都太快了。我们如此忙碌——就好像我们每个人的中间名都是“多任务”。但现在，在你表现的假仁假义前，你的电脑上有多少多余的标签？</p>

<p>听着，我们需要时间来从这场竞赛中逃离，为了我们的家人、朋友和我们的精神状态，我们需要重新倒带、重新充电、重新连接的时间——而不是回复办公室那些应该被转寄出去的邮件。</p>

<p>不能重做、不能倒带、没有像DVD菜单一样可以跳回上一幕。问问你自己，你又多少次差点要去旅行？你几乎看到了多少风景？你遗失了多少时刻，思考着下一刻？认为一旦你得到了这个或去了那里，会是最好的。</p>

<p>但是踏出小小几步如何？短途旅行、长时间跳舞、无人打扰。花时间陪伴家人而非同事、花时间沉思而非生气。看真正的日出而不是电脑屏幕上的、用棕榈树代替掌上电脑，复印机用——老天，我真的恨透了复印机。</p>

<p>I read a study yesterday. It said that last year, more than half of us actually choose not to take our full vacations from our jobs.</p>
<p>Question: Don't you think it's crazy that so many of us go into work even when we don't need to be there? Times we could be on the beach buried in sand or traveling the earth, we spend it in the office, traveling from desk to desk, buried in paperwork.</p>

<p>See, we all need time to get away from the race, for our family, friends, for the sake of our mental state, time to rewind, recharge, and reconnect -- not reporting to the office on emails that should be on redirect.</p>
