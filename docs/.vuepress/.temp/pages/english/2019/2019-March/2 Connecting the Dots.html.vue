<p>我给你们举一个例子吧：那个时候里德大学的书法课大概是全国最好的。学校里每张海报和每个抽屉标签的字都漂亮/</p>

<p>这门课太棒了，是一种科学永远不能捕捉到的既美丽又富有历史价值的精妙艺术。</p>

<p>当时我并不指望书法能有什么实际应用价值，但十年时候，当我们在设计第一台Macintosh电脑时，所学的一切都浮现在我眼前。我把这些东西都设计进了Mac，那是第一台拥有这么漂亮文字版式的电脑。</p>

<p>如果当时我没有参加这门课的话，Mac就不会又这么多丰富的字体以及合理的字体间距。要不是Windows照搬了Mac，现在的个人电脑就不会有这么美妙的字体了。</p>

<p>如果我不退学，就不会选择这门书法课，个人电脑就不会有这么完美的字体版式。</p>

<p>当我在上学的时候我还不能把这些连起来，但十年之后回顾这一切但时候，一切都豁然开朗了。</p>

<p>再说一次，你在向前走的途中不能将这些片段连接起来，只能在你回顾的时候才能将这些串联起来。</p>

<p>所以你要相信这些片段会在你将来的某一天串联起来。你必须相信自己的直觉，命运，生活，因缘。</p>
