<p>很荣幸和大家一起参加这次的毕业典礼，斯坦福大学是世界上最好的大学之一。</p>

<p>说实话，我大学没毕业，今天是我第一次离大学毕业这么近。</p>

<p>今天我想给你们分享我生活中的三个故事，不讲别的，也不是什么大道理，就只是三个故事。</p>

<p>第一个故事是把点串起来。</p>

<p>我再里德大学读了六个月就退学了，此后便再学校当旁听生，18个月后我才真正的离开了学校。</p>

<p>我为什么要退学呢？故事要从我还未出生时讲起。我的生母是一个年轻的，未婚大学毕业生，因此她决定让别人来收养我。</p>
<h4 id="she-felt-very-strongly-that-i-should-be-adopted-by-college-graduates-so-everything-was-all-set-for-me-to-be-adopted-at-birth-by-a-lawyer-and-his-wife-except-that-when-i-popped-out-thay-decided-for-the-last-minute-that-they-really-wanted-a-girl" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#she-felt-very-strongly-that-i-should-be-adopted-by-college-graduates-so-everything-was-all-set-for-me-to-be-adopted-at-birth-by-a-lawyer-and-his-wife-except-that-when-i-popped-out-thay-decided-for-the-last-minute-that-they-really-wanted-a-girl" aria-hidden="true">#</a> She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

<p>她很想让我被上过大学的人收养，所以当我一出生的时候，我就注定要被以为律师和他的妻子收养。可是在我出生之后，律师夫妇最终决定他们想要一个女孩。</p>
<h4 id="so-my-parents-who-were-on-a-waiting-list-got-a-call-in-the-middle-of-the-night-asking-we-ve-got-an-unexpected-baby-boy-do-you-want-him-they-said-of-course" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#so-my-parents-who-were-on-a-waiting-list-got-a-call-in-the-middle-of-the-night-asking-we-ve-got-an-unexpected-baby-boy-do-you-want-him-they-said-of-course" aria-hidden="true">#</a> So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:&quot;We've got an unexpected baby boy, do you want him?&quot; They said:&quot;Of course.&quot;</h4>
<p>就这样，我的养父母（他们当时在等待名单上），半夜接到一个电话：“我们这有一个没人要的男婴，你们想要吗？”他们说：“当然要！”</p>
<h4 id="my-biological-mother-found-out-later-that-my-mother-had-never-graduated-from-college-and-that-my-father-had-never-graduated-from-high-school-she-refused-to-sign-the-final-adoption-papers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#my-biological-mother-found-out-later-that-my-mother-had-never-graduated-from-college-and-that-my-father-had-never-graduated-from-high-school-she-refused-to-sign-the-final-adoption-papers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.

<p>随后我的生母发现，我的养母没有大学文凭，而我的养父甚至连高中都没毕业。所以她拒绝签这份收养合同。</p>

<p>不过没几个月，我的生母就心软了。因为我的养父母答应一定会让我上大学。我的生活就这样开始了。</p>

<p>十七年之后，我真的上了大学。可我天真的选了一所和斯坦福一样贵的学校，我的工薪阶层的父母把他们所有的积蓄都花在了我的学费上。</p>

<p>读了六个月之后，我看不到上学的价值所在。我不知道自己这辈子要干什么也不清楚学校是否能帮我找到答案。而我已经几乎花光了父母的所有积蓄。</p>

<p>所以我决定退学，并相信退学之后一切都能照常发展。当时做这样的决定是非常危险的，但现在回想起来，这是我一生中做的最棒的一个决定。</p>

<p>从我退学那一刻起，我终于不用去读那些让我不感兴趣的课程了，然后我开始旁听一些看起来有意思的课程。</p>

<p>I am honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in world.</p>
<p>Truth to be told, I never graduated from college. And this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.</p>
<p>Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.</p>
<p>The first story is about connecting the dots.</p>
<p>I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.</p>
<p>So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption.</p>
<p>She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided for the last minute that they really wanted a girl.</p>
<p>So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:&quot;We've got an unexpected baby boy, do you want him?&quot; They said:&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p>My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers.</p>
<p>She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.</p>
<p>And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.</p>
<p>After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.</p>
<p>So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.</p>
<p>The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.</p>
