<p>The word learning has great significance.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of learning.</p>
<p>For most of us learning means the accumulation of knowledge, of experience, of technology, of a skill, of a language.</p>
<p>There is also psychological learning, learning through experience, either the <code v-pre>immediate</code> experience of life, which leave a certain <code v-pre>residue</code>, of tradition, of the race, of society.</p>
<p>There are these two kinds of learning how to meet life: psychological and physiological; outward skill and inward skill.</p>
<p>There is really no line of <code v-pre>demarcation</code> between the two; they <code v-pre>overlap</code>.</p>
<p>We are not considering for the moment the skill that we learn through practice, the technological knowledge that we acquire through study.</p>
<p>What we are concerned about is the psychological learning that we have acquired through the <code v-pre>centuries</code> or inherited as tradition, as knowledge, as experience.</p>
<p>This we call learning, but I question wether it is learning at all.</p>
<p>I am not talking about learning a skill, a language, a technique, but I am asking whether the mind ever learns psychologically.</p>
<p>It has learned, and with what it has learned it meets the challenge of life.</p>
<p>It is always translating life or the new challenge according to what it has learned.</p>
<p>That is what we are doing, is that learning?</p>
<p>Doesn't learning imply something new, something that I don't know and am learning?</p>
<p>If I am merely adding to what I already know, it is no longer learning.</p>
