<p>Wisdom is something that has to be discovered by each one, and it is not the result of knowledge.</p>
<p>Knowledge and wisdom do not go together.</p>
<p>Wisdom comes when there is maturity of self-knowing.</p>
<p>Without knowing oneself, order is not possible, and therefore there is no virtue.</p>
<p>Now, learning about oneself, and accumulating knowledge about oneself, are two different things...</p>
<p>A mind that is acquiring knowledge is never learning.</p>
<p>What it is doing is this: it is gathering to itself information, experience as knowledge, and from the background of what it has gathered, it experiences, it learns; and therefore it is never really learning, but always knowing, acquiring.</p>
<p>Learning is always in the active present; it has no past.</p>
<p>The moment you say to yourself, &quot;I have learned,&quot; it has already become knowledge, and from the background of that knowledge you can accumulate, translate, but you cannot further learn.</p>
<p>It is only a mind that is not acquiring, but always learning - it is only such a mind that can understand this whole entity that we call the &quot;me,&quot; the self.</p>
<p>I have to know myself, the structure, the nature, the significance of the total entity; but I can't do that burdened with my previous knowledge, with my previous experience, or with a mind that is conditioned, for then I am not learning, I am merely interpreting, translating, looking with an eye that is already clouded by the past.</p>
