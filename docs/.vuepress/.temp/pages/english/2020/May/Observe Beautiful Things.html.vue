<p>I once had a teacher whose husband died suddenly of a heart attack.</p>
<p>About a week after his death, she shared some of her thoughts with a classroom of students.</p>
<p>As the late afternoon sunlight shone through the classroom windows and the class was nearly over, she removed a few things aside on the edge of her desk and sat down there.</p>
<p>With a gentle look on her face, she paused and said, &quot;Before class is over, I'd like to share with all of you a thought that is unrelated to class, but which I feel is very important.</p>
<p>Each of us is put here on earth to learn, share, love, appreciate and give of ourselves.</p>
<p>None of us knows when this fantastic experience will end.</p>
<p>It can be taken away at any moment, so we must make the most out of every single day.&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes were beginning to water, but she went on, &quot;So I would like you all to make me a promise.</p>
<p>From now on, on your way to school, or on your way home, find something beautiful to enjoy, it doesn't have to be something you see.</p>
<p>It could be the smell of freshly baked bread floating out of someone's house, or it could be the sound of the breeze rustling the leaves in the trees...</p>
