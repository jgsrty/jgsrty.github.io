We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;.

And every few summers, we'd join the caravan. We'd <code v-pre>hitch</code> up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips. One one particular trip, I was about 10 years old. I was rolling around in the big bench seat in the back of the car. My grandfather was driving. And my grandmother had the passenger seat. She smoked throughout these trips, and I hated the smell.</h4>
<p>在我小时候，我总是在德克萨斯州祖父母的农场里度过夏天。我帮忙修理过风车，为牛接种疫苗，还有一些其他的杂活。每天下午，我们都会看肥皂剧，特别是《Days of our Lives》这部。我的祖父母参加了一个俱乐部，这个俱乐部是一群游历于美国和加拿大的Airstream房车车主。每隔几个夏天，我们会加入一次旅行队伍。我们把Airstream拖车挂在祖父的汽车后面，和300多名冒险者一起出发。我爱我的祖父母，并且非常崇拜他们，我也非常期待这样的旅行。有一次旅行很特殊，那时候我大概10岁左右。我那时候躺坐在汽车后排的长椅上，我的祖父开着车，祖母坐在副驾驶，整个旅途中她一直在抽烟，我很讨厌烟味。</p>

I'd calculate our gas <code v-pre>mileage</code>, figure out useless <code v-pre>statistics</code> on things like <code v-pre>grocery</code> spending. I'd been hearing an ad <code v-pre>campaign</code> about smoking. I can't remember the details, but basically the ad said, every <code v-pre>puff</code> of a cigarette takes some number of minutes off of your life. I think it might have been two minutes per puff. At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother. I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on. When I was satisfied that I'd come up with a reasonable number, I <code v-pre>poked</code> my head into the front of the car, tapped my grandmother on the shoulder, and proudly <code v-pre>proclaimed</code>, &quot;At two minutes per puff, you've taken nine years off your life!&quot; I have a <code v-pre>vivid</code> memory of what happened, and it was not what I expected. I expected to be <code v-pre>applauded</code> for my cleverness and arithmetic skills. &quot;Jeff, you're so smart. You had to have made some <code v-pre>tricky</code> estimates, figure out the number of minutes in a year and do some <code v-pre>division</code>.&quot; That's not what happened. Instead, my grandmother <code v-pre>burst</code> into tears. I sat in the backseat and did not know what to do. While my grandmother sat crying, my grandfather, who had been driving in silence, pulled over onto the shoulder of the highway. He got out of the car and came around and opened my door and waited for me to follow. Was I in trouble? My grandfather was a highly <code v-pre>intelligent</code>, quiet man. He had never said a <code v-pre>harsh</code> word to me, and maybe this was to be the first time? Or maybe he would ask that I get back in the car and apologize to my grandmother. I had no experience in this <code v-pre>realm</code> with my grandparents and no way to <code v-pre>gauge</code> what the <code v-pre>consequences</code> might be. We stopped beside the trailer. My grandfather looked at me, and after a bit of silence, he gently and calmly said, &quot;Jeff, one day you'll understand that it's harder to be kind than clever.&quot;</h4>
<p>那时候的我总是会想尽办法做一些估算或小算数。我计算过我们的油耗和一些没什么用的杂物话费等。我记得我听过一个关于抽烟等广告活动，我不太记得清具体的细节了，但是那个广告主要说的是，每抽进去的一口烟都会减少几分钟的寿命。我想大概是没口烟两分钟吧。无论如何，我决定为我的祖母做个算数。我估算了每天抽几根烟，每根烟大概抽几口等等。当我心满意足的得出了一个合理的数字，我把头伸向了车的前座，拍了拍祖母的肩膀，并自豪的宣读着：按照每抽一口烟两分钟算，您已经失去了九年的寿命了。我清楚的记得当时发生了什么，不是为期待的结果，我期望我的聪明和算数得到赞扬。杰夫，你非常的聪明，你应该做一些更难的估算，算以下每年有多少分钟，做一些除法。但这些并没有发生。事实上，我的祖母突然就哭了，我坐回了后排作为不知道怎么办才好。祖母哭泣的时候，我的祖父安静的把车开到了路肩上。他从车上下来，打开我的车门让我跟着他。我惹了什么麻烦了？我的祖父是一个很聪明并且祥和的人，他从来没对我说过一句严厉的话，或许这会是第一次吧？又或许他会让我返回车上跟祖母道歉。我在这方面完全没有经验并且不能够猜测究竟会是什么结果。我们在拖车旁边停了下来。我的祖父看着我，在一小段的安静过后，他温和的对我说：杰夫，总有一天你会明白善良比聪明更难。</p>

<p>今天，我想告诉大家的就是天赋和选择的不同之处。聪明是天赋，善良是选择。聪明对你们来说不难，你们已经拥有了。而选择却不简单。稍不注意你就会被你的天赋所诱惑，如果你这样做了，将会对你的选择造成伤害。在座的都是有天赋的人。我确信的你们的天赋之一就是拥有聪明能干的大脑。我相信这个事实，因为入学竞争很激烈，如果你们没有聪明这个标签，院长也不会让你们来到这里。</p>

<p>16年前，我有了创建亚马逊的想法.我发现互联网用户以每年2300%的速度在增长，我从未见到或听说过任何事情有这样的增长速度，而在网上建立一个包含几百万种书的书店这种想法，在现实中是根本不可能存在，这让我非常兴奋。那时候我才30岁，刚好结婚一年。我告诉我的妻子MacKenzie，我想要辞掉工作去做这个疯狂的事情，这很可能失败，因为大多数创业者都是这样的，并且我不能确定在那之后会怎样。MacKenzie（也是普林斯顿毕业的，就坐在下面的第二排）告诉我我应该去做这件事。小时候，我是一个车库里的发明家。我发明了一个充满水泥的轮胎的自动门，一个用伞和锡箔纸做的并不太好用的太阳能炒锅，烘焙盘子做的报警器并且吓到了我的邻居们。我曾一直想成为一个发明家，并且她希望我能追随我的热情所在。</p>

是选择小心翼翼，还是选择莽撞一点？
面对强硬的时候，是选择放弃，还是坚定前行？
是选择做个愤世嫉俗的人，还是选择做一个建设者？
是选择在其他人面前耗尽聪明，还是选择善良？
我赌一个预言。当你80岁的时候，在一个安静的时候去回想叙述自己这一生，最得意，最有意义的时刻，将会是你所做的一系列选择。最后，是选择造就了我们，建造属于自己的伟大故事吧。
谢谢大家，祝各位好运！</p>

<h2 id="原文阅读" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#原文阅读" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 原文阅读</h2>
<p>As a kid, I spent my summers with my grandparents on their ranch in Texas. I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;. My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. Aand every few summers, we'd join the caravan. We'd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips. On one particular trip, I was about 10 years old. I was rolling around in the big bench seat in the back of the car. My grandfather was driving. Aand my grandmother had the passenger seat. She smoked throughout these trips, and I hated the smell.</p>
<p>At that age, I'd take any excuse to make estimates and do minor arithmetic. I'd calculate our gas mileage -- figure out useless statistics on things like grocery spending. I'd been hearing an ad campaign about smoking. I can't remember the details, but basically the ad said, every puff of a cigarette takes some number of minutes off of your life. I think it might have been two minutes per puff. At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother. I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on. When I was satisfied that I'd come up with a reasonable number, I poked my head into the front of the car, tapped my grandmother on the shoulder, and proudly proclaimed, &quot;At two minutes per puff, you've taken nine years off your life!&quot; I have a vivid memory of what happened, and it was not I expected. I expected to be applauded for my cleverness and arithmetic skills. &quot;Jeff, you're so smart. You had to have make some tricky estimates, figure out the number of minutes in a year and do some division.&quot; That's not what happended. Instead, my grandmother burst into tears. I sat in the backseat and did not know what to do. While my grandmother sat crying, my grandfather, who had been driving in silence, pulled over onto the shoulder of the highway. He got out of the car and came around and opended my door and waited for me to follow. Was I in trouble? My grandfather was a highly intelligent, quiet man. He has never said a harsh word to me, and maybe this was to be the first time? Or maybe he would ask that I get back in the car and apologize to my grandmother. I had no experience in this realm with my grandparents and no way to guage what the consequences might be. We stoped beside the trailer. My grandfather looded at me, and after a bit of silence, he gently and calmly said, &quot;Jeff, one day you'll understand that it's harder to be kind than clever.&quot;</p>
<p>What I want to talk to you about today if the difference between gifts and choices. Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy -- they're given after all. Choices can be hard. You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the detriment of your choices. This is a group with many gifts. I'm sure one of your gifts is the gift of a smart and capable brain. I'm confident that's the case because the admission is competitive and if there weren't some signs that you're clever, the dean of admission  wouldn't  have let you in.</p>
<p>Your smarts will come in handy because you will travel in a land of marvels. We humans -- plodding as we are -- will astonish ourselves. We'll invent ways to generate clean energy and a lot of it. Atom by atom, we'll assemble tiny machines that will enter cell walls and make repairs. This month comes the extraordinary but also inevitable news that we've synthesized life. In the coming years, we'll not only synthesize it, but we'll engineer it to specifications. I believe you'll even see us understand the human brain. Jules Verne, Mark Twain, Galileo, Newton -- all the curious from the ages would have wanted to be alive most of all right now. As a civilization, we will have so many gifts, just as you as individuals have so many individual gifts as you sit before me. How will you use these gifts? And will you take pride in your gifts or pride in your choices?</p>
<p>I got the idea to start Amazon 16 years ago. I came acroll the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles -- something that simply couldn't exist in the pysical world -- was very exciting to me. I had just turned 30 years old, and I'd been married for a year. I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go to this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most startups don't, and I was sure what would happed after that. MacKenzie(also a Princeton grad and sitting here in the second row) told me I should go for it. As a young boy, I'd been a garage inventer. I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar worker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings. I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wangted me to follow my passion.</p>

I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet. He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said,&quot;That sounds like a readlly good idea, but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn't already have a good job.&quot; That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision. Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all. After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, in a very real sense, your life -- the life you author from scratch on your own -- begins.
How will you use your gifts? What choices will you make?
Will inertia be your guide, or will you follow your passions?
Will you follow dogma, or will you be original?
Will you choose a life of ease, or a life of service and adventure?
Will you wilt under criticism, or will you follow your convictions?
Will you bluff it out when you're wrong, or will you apologize?
Will you guard your heart against rejection, or will you act when you fall in love?
Will you play it safe, or will you be a little bit swashbuckling?
When it's tough, will you give up, or will you be relentless?
Will you be a cynic, or will you be a builder?
Will you be clever at the expense of others, or will you be kind?</p>
<p>I will hazard a prediction. When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story.</p>
<p>Thank you and good luck!</p>
