### Please include reasons and details in your explanation

## 翻译

I think a healthy life style consists of two parts, good diet and exercise.

We are what we eat. Our physique and well-being depend on the food that we put into our mouth. I try to eat as healthy as possible. That means more freash ingredients,
less processed food. And binging is definitely out of the question. Of course we all have cravings sometimes. For example, I allow myself to indulge and eat a hamburger on occasion, but it only happens a couple of time a year.

However, having a good diet alone isn't enough. Exercise is another key element in a healthy lifestyle. I go to the gym at least three times a week no matter how tired I am. It's painful process but always feel refreshed after working out. Furthermore, I find exercising a very good way to de-stress myself as well.

Well, that's how I keep myself healthy, by having a good balance between diet and exercise.
