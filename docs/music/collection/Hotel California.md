## Lyric 歌词

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air

Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light

My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim

I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway;

I heard the mission bell

And I was thinking to myself,

"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"

Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way

There were voices down the corridor,

I thought I heard them say...


Welcome to the Hotel California

Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)

Such a lovely face

Plenty of rooms at the Hotel California

Any time of year (Any time of year)

You can find it here


Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz

She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends

How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.

Some dance to remember, some dance to forget


So I called up the Captain,

"Please bring me my wine"

He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"

And still those voices are calling from far away,

Wake you up in the middle of the night

Just to hear them say...


Welcome to the Hotel California

Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)

Such a lovely face

They living it up at the Hotel California

What nice surprise (what nice surprise)

Bring your alibis


Mirrors on the ceiling,

The pink champagne on ice

And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"

In the master's chambers,

They gathered for the feast

They stabbed it with their steely knives,

But they just can't kill the beast


Last thing I remember, I was

Running for the door

I had to find the passage back

To the place I was before

"Relax, " said the night man,

"We are programmed to receive.

You can check-out any time you like,

But you can never leave!
