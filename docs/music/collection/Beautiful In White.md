## Lyric 歌词
Not sure if you know this

But when we first met

I got so nervous I couldn't speak

In that very moment

I found the one and 

My life had found it's missing piece

So as long as I live I love you

Will have and hold you

You look so beautiful in white

And from now to my very last breath

This day I'll cherish

You look so beautiful in white Tonight

What we have is timeless

My love is endless

And with this ring I say to the world

You're my every reason

You're all that I believe in

With all my heart I mean every word

So as long as I live I love you

Will have and hold you

You look so beautiful in white

And from now to my very last breath

This day I'll cherish

You look so beautiful in white Tonight

You look so beautiful in white

So beautiful in white

And if our daughter is what our future holds

I hope she has your eyes

Finds love like you and I did

Yeah, if she falls in love and we will let her go

I'll walk her down the aisle

She looks so beautiful in white

So beautiful in white

So as long as I live I love you

Will have and hold you

You look so beautiful in white

And from now to my very last breath

This day I'll cherish

You look so beautiful in white Tonight

So beautiful in white Tonight
