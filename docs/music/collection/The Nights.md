## Lyric 歌词

Once upon a younger year

When all our shadows disappeared

The animals inside came out to play

When face to face with all our fears

Learned our lessons through the tears

Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father, he told me son don't let it slip away

He took me in his arms, I heard him say

When you get older, your wild life will live for younger days

Think of me if ever you're afraid

He said one day, you'll leave this world behind

So live a life you will remember

My father told me when I was just a child

These are the nights that never die

My father told me

When thunderclouds start pouring down

Light a fire they can't put out

Carve you name into the shining stars

He said go venture far beyound the shores

Don't forsake this life of yours

I guide you home no matter where you are

One day my father, he told me son don't let it slip away

When I was just a kid I heard him say

When you get older, your wild life will live for younger day

Think of me if ever you're afraid
