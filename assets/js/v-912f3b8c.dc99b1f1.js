It was just sex.&quot;</p><p>Ah, yes, page one of the philanderer&#39;s handbook.</p><p>Yeah, and then he got this zen look on his face,</p><p>and he said, &quot;you know, Susan,</p><p>most men live lives of quiet desperation.&quot;</p><p>Please tell me you punched him.</p><p>No. I said, &quot;Really? And what do most women</p><p>lead lives of noisy fulfillment?&quot;</p><p>Hmm.

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready to start dating yet.</p><p>You need to get back out there.</p><p>Come on.

I brought you a little house-warming gift.</p><p>I should&#39;ve brought something by earlier, but</p><p>Actually, you&#39;re the first to stop by. - Really?</p><p>Susan knew she was lucky.</p><p>An eligible bachelor had moved on to Wisteria Lane - Welcome</p><p>and she was the first to find out.</p><p>But she also knew that good news...</p><p>Hello there. - ...Travels quickly.</p><p>Edie Britt was the most predatory</p><p>divorce in a five-block radius.</p><p>Her conquests were numerous.</p><p>Varied.</p><p>and legendary.</p><p>Hi, Susan.

I&#39;d invite you both in,</p><p>but I was sort of in the middle of something.</p><p>I&#39;m late for an appointment.</p><p>I just wanted to say hi.</p><p>And just like that, the race for Mike Delfino had begun.</p><p>For a moment, Susan wondered if her rivalry with Edie</p><p>would remain friendly.</p><p>Oh, Mike, I heard you&#39;re a plumber.</p><p>But she was reminded that when it came to men...</p><p>Do you think you could stop by later and take a look at my pipes?</p><p>...Women don&#39;t fight fair. - Sure.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Bye, Susan.</p><p>You can&#39;t order me around like I am a child.</p><p>Gabrielle.</p><p>No, no. I&#39;m not going.</p><p>It&#39;s business. Tanaka expects everyone to bring their wives.</p><p>Every time I&#39;m around that man, he tries to grab my ass.</p><p>I made over 200,000 doing business with him last year.</p><p>If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.</p><p>John.</p><p>Mr. Solis, you scared me.</p><p>Why is that bush there? You were supposed to dig it up last week.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have time. - I don&#39;t want to hear your excuses.</p><p>Just take care of it.</p><p>I really hate the way you talk to me.</p><p>And I hate that I spent $15,000 on your diamond necklace</p><p>which you couldn&#39;t live without.</p><p>But I&#39;m learning to deal with it.</p><p>So can I tell Tanaka we&#39;ll be there tomorrow?</p><p>John, we have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.</p><p>Thanks, Mrs. Solis.</p><p>Fine, I&#39;ll go.</p><p>But I&#39;m keeping my back pressed</p><p>against the wall the entire time.</p><p>See, now this is what a marriage is all about.</p><p>Compromise.</p><p>Is your finger ok? - Yeah, it&#39;s just a small cut.</p><p>Let me see. Mmm.</p><p>You know, Mrs. Solis, I really like it when we hook up,</p><p>but, um, you know, I got to get my work done and...</p><p>...I can&#39;t afford to lose this job.</p><p>This table was hand-carved.</p><p>Carlos had it imported from Italy.</p><p>It cost him $23,000.</p><p>You want to do it on the table this time?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Why can&#39;t we ever have normal soup?</p><p>Danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree.</p><p>Just once,</p><p>couldn&#39;t we have a soup that people have heard of?</p><p>Like French onion or navy bean.</p><p>First of all, your father can&#39;t eat onions.</p><p>He&#39;s deathly allergic. And I won&#39;t</p><p>even dignify your navy bean suggestion.</p><p>So... how&#39;s the osso buco?</p><p>It&#39;s ok. - It&#39;s ok?</p><p>Andrew, I spent three hours cooking this meal.</p><p>How do you think it makes me feel when you</p><p>say &quot;it&#39;s okay&quot; in that sullen tone?</p><p>Who asked you to spend three hours on dinner?</p><p>Excuse me?</p><p>Tim Harper&#39;s mom gets home from work,</p><p>pops open a can of pork and beans,</p><p>and boom, they&#39;re eating.

I am begging.</p><p>I&#39;m saying,</p><p>do you always have to serve cuisine?</p><p>Can&#39;t we ever just have food?</p><p>Are you doing drugs? - What?</p><p>Change in behavior is one of the warning signs,</p><p>and you have been as fresh as</p><p>paint for the last six months.</p><p>That certainly would explain</p><p>why you&#39;re always locked in the bathroom.</p><p>Trust me, that is not what he is doing.</p><p>Shut up.</p><p>Mom, I&#39;m not the one with the problem here, all right?</p><p>You&#39;re the one always acting like</p><p>she&#39;s running for mayor of Stepford.</p><p>Rex... Seeing that you&#39;re the head of this household,</p><p>I would really appreciate you saying something.</p><p>Pass thee salt?</p><p>Three days after my funeral,</p><p>Lynette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion.</p><p>Indignation.</p><p>Tom, this is my fifth message,</p><p>and you still haven&#39;t called me back.</p><p>Well, you must be having a lot of fun</p><p>on your business trip. I can only imagine.</p><p>Well, guess what -- The kids and I want to have some fun, too,</p><p>so unless you call me back by noon,</p><p>we are getting on a plane and joining you.</p><p>Mom.</p><p>Not now. Mommy&#39;s threatening daddy.</p><p>Mom. - No, I...</p><p>Where are your brothers? - Noodles, my favorite.</p><p>Lyneettee Scavo? - Crap.</p><p>Natalie Klein. I don&#39;t believe it.</p><p>Lynette. How long has it been?</p><p>Years. Uh, how are you?</p><p>How&#39;s the firm?</p><p>Good. Everyone misses you.</p><p>We all say if you hadn&#39;t quit,</p><p>you&#39;d be running the place by now.</p><p>Yeah, well.</p><p>So... How&#39;s domestic life?</p><p>Don&#39;t you just love being a mom?</p><p>And there it was. The question that Lynette always dreaded.</p><p>Well, to be honest...</p><p>For those who asked it, only one answer was acceptable,</p><p>So Lynette responded as she always did. She lied.</p><p>It&#39;s the best job I&#39;ve ever had.</p><p>You know what I don&#39;t get? - What?</p><p>Why you married Mr. Solis.</p><p>Well... He promised to give me</p><p>everything I&#39;ve ever wanted.</p><p>And did he? - Yes.</p><p>Then why aren&#39;t you happy?</p><p>Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.</p><p>So do you love him?</p><p>I do.</p><p>Well, then, why are we here? Why are we doing this?</p><p>Because I don&#39;t want to wake up one morning</p><p>with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.</p><p>Hey, can I have a drag? - Absolutely not.</p><p>You are much too young to smoke.</p><p>How would you feel about me using your</p><p>child-support payments for plastic surgery?</p><p>Stop being so nervous. You&#39;re just</p><p>asking him to dinner. No big deal.</p><p>You&#39;re right.</p><p>So is that your project for school?</p><p>You know, when I was in fifth grade,</p><p>I made the White House out of sugar cubes.</p><p>Stop stalling and go.</p><p>Before Mike figures out he can do better.</p><p>Tell me again why I fought for custody of you.</p><p>You were using me to hurt dad. - Oh, that&#39;s right.</p><p>Oh, god.</p><p>Hi. - Hey, Susan.</p><p>Are you busy?</p><p>No, not at all. What&#39;s up?</p><p>Well, I... I just, uh, was wondering if...</p><p>...if there was any chance that you, uh...</p><p>...I just wanted to ask if...</p><p>Edie. - Hey, there, Susan.</p><p>What are you...? - I was making ambrosia.</p><p>And I made too much so I thought</p><p>I&#39;d bring some over to Mike.</p><p>What&#39;s going on?</p><p>Susan was just going to ask me something.</p><p>I have a clog. - Excuse me?</p><p>And you&#39;re a plumber, right? - Yeah.</p><p>The clog&#39;s in the pipe. - Yeah,</p><p>That&#39;s usually where they are.</p><p>Well, I&#39;ve got one.</p><p>Ok.

Hello, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>We didn&#39;t get a chance to talk at</p><p>Mary Alice&#39;s wake. How are you doing?</p><p>Bree longed to share the truth about</p><p>her husband&#39;s painful betrayal,</p><p>but sadly for Bree,</p><p>admitting defeat was not an option.</p><p>Great. Everything is just great.</p><p>Okay, well, I got you the honey mustard dressing.</p><p>The ranch looked just a little bit suspect.</p><p>Are we going to talk about what I said?</p><p>If you think I&#39;m going to discuss the dissolution</p><p>of my marriage in a place</p><p>where the restrooms are labeled &quot;chicks&quot; and &quot;dudes,&quot;</p><p>you&#39;re out of your mind.</p><p>What&#39;s in this?</p><p>What do you mean, what&#39;s in this? It&#39;s salad.</p><p>With... with onions. - What?</p><p>You put onions in my salad. - No, I didn&#39;t.</p><p>Oh, wait.</p><p>The sound that awakened my son was</p><p>something he&#39;d heard only once before.</p><p>Many years ago when he was quite young.</p><p>But he recognized it instantly.</p><p>It was the sound of a family secret.</p><p>Seven days after my funeral, life on Wisteria Lane</p><p>finally returned to normal.</p><p>Which, for some of my friends, was unfortunate.</p><p>Mommy, mommy! - Now what?</p><p>Daddy&#39;s home!</p><p>Come on! Hey, is anybody home?</p><p>I wasn&#39;t expecting you for a week.</p><p>I have to go back to &#39;Frisco in the morning.</p><p>But I got your call. You sounded frazzled.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>It&#39;s been a little rough. - Hi. Yeah. Peaches.</p><p>Did you buy us any presents?</p><p>Oh, god, presents. Wait up. Let me see.</p><p>Ohhh! - Yeah!</p><p>But I&#39;m not giving it to you unless</p><p>you promise to go outside right now</p><p>and practise throwing for 20 minutes. You promise?</p><p>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - Punks. Get out!</p><p>Who&#39;s open? Go out. Deeper. Deeper. Touchdown!</p><p>Oh, my god.</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>You got to be kidding. I&#39;m exhausted.</p><p>I look terrible. I&#39;m covered in peaches.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, baby. I got to have you.</p><p>Well, is it ok if I just lie here?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>I love you. - I love you more.</p><p>Wait. I gotta tell you I was having trouble with swelling.</p><p>The doctor took me off the pill.</p><p>You just gotta put on a condom.</p><p>A condom? - Yeah.</p><p>What&#39;s the big deal? Let&#39;s risk it.</p><p>Let&#39;s risk it? - Yeah.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe you tried to kill me.</p><p>Yes, well, I feel badly about that.</p><p>I told you Mrs. Huber came over</p><p>and I got distracted. It was a mistake.</p><p>Since when do you make mistakes?</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>It means I&#39;m sick of you being</p><p>so damn perfect all the time.</p><p>I&#39;m sick of the bizarre way your hair doesn&#39;t move.</p><p>I&#39;m sick of you making our bed in the</p><p>morning before I&#39;ve used the bathroom.</p><p>You&#39;re this plastic suburban housewife,</p><p>with her pearls and spatula,</p><p>who says things like &quot;we owe the Hendersons a dinner.&quot;</p><p>Where&#39;s the woman I fell in love with...</p><p>...Who used to burn the toast and</p><p>drink milk out of the carton?</p><p>and laugh.</p><p>I need her.</p><p>Not this cold, perfect thing you&#39;ve become.</p><p>These need water.</p><p>Bree sobbed quietly in the restroom for five minutes,</p><p>but her husband never knew.</p><p>Because when Bree finally emerged...</p><p>...she was perfect.</p><p>I found my earrings. We can go now.</p><p>Was John here today?</p><p>Well, yeah.</p><p>The lawn hasn&#39;t been mowed. I&#39;ve had it.</p><p>We&#39;re getting a real gardener.</p><p>Why? - Are you deaf?</p><p>I just said he&#39;s not doing his job.</p><p>It&#39;s dark. You just can&#39;t see the lawn has been mowed.</p><p>It hasn&#39;t been. Feel this grass.</p><p>I&#39;m not feeling the grass.</p><p>Let&#39;s just get going. Come on, we&#39;re late.</p><p>Take care of it. - Yes, sir.</p><p>There&#39;s Tanaka. Time for me to go and do my dance.</p><p>Good luck, sweetheart.</p><p>Excuse me. - Ma&#39;am.</p><p>You see that man just walked away?</p><p>Can you make sure he has a drink in his hand all night long?</p><p>Yes, ma&#39;am.</p><p>Susan? Susan! - Mrs. Huber, how are you doing?</p><p>Not too well, I&#39;m afraid.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to find something to soothe my stomach.</p><p>It&#39;s upset? - Yeah.</p><p>I had the worst macaroni and cheese at the wake.</p><p>It&#39;s been running through me ever since.</p><p>And I need to be at my best.</p><p>Edie Britt&#39;s son is spending the night tonight.</p><p>He&#39;s spending the night?</p><p>Apparently Edie is having a gentleman friend over for dinner,</p><p>and I think she plans on entertaining into the wee hours,</p><p>if you know what I mean.</p><p>Oh, here&#39;s some antacid. Have you ever tried this?</p><p>I can&#39;t believe it. This can&#39;t be happening.</p><p>Mike can&#39;t like Edie better than me. He just can&#39;t.</p><p>You don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.</p><p>Maybe they&#39;re just having dinner.</p><p>You&#39;re right. They&#39;re doing it.</p><p>Edie?</p><p>Edie?</p><p>Hello? Anybody home?</p><p>I need to borrow sugar.</p><p>Oh, my god! Oh, yes! Give it to me!</p><p>And just like that, the possibility Susan had clung to,</p><p>the maybe of Mike Delfino, was gone forever.</p><p>And despite the precariousness of her situation,</p><p>Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.</p><p>It didn&#39;t take Susan long to realize,</p><p>this was just not her night.</p><p>Is somebody out there?</p><p>Oh, my god! That&#39;s smoke!</p><p>Oh, my god.</p><p>She left candles unattended in the den.</p><p>Paramedic said she was lucky.</p><p>She could&#39;ve been killed.</p><p>She ran out with nothing on.</p><p>She was having sex with some guy when the fire started.</p><p>What happened to him?</p><p>He got smoke inhalation. He&#39;s at the hospital.</p><p>Susan, are you all right? You look awful.</p><p>I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m fine. I just, uh, feel really bad for Edie.</p><p>Oh, honey, don&#39;t worry about Edie. She&#39;s a strong lady.</p><p>Absolutely. She&#39;ll get through this.</p><p>She&#39;ll find a way to survive.</p><p>We all do.</p><p>Come on.</p><p>Wow! What happened? - Mike!</p><p>And suddenly there he was.</p><p>Like a phoenix rising from the ashes.</p><p>I... I thought you were... Uh... Where were you?</p><p>I just got back from the movies. Edie had a fire, huh?</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, but she&#39;s fine now.</p><p>Everything&#39;s fine now.</p><p>And just like that, Susan was happy.</p><p>Life was suddenly full of... possibilities.</p><p>Not to mention a few unexpected surprises.</p><p>Hello. - It&#39;s me.</p><p>Have anything yet? - No, nothing yet.</p><p>But don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m definitely getting closer.</p><p>I brought some champagne.</p><p>I thought we should have a toast.</p><p>The next day my friends came together</p><p>to pack away my clothes,</p><p>my personal belongings and what was left of my life.</p><p>All right, ladies, lift &#39;em up.</p><p>To Mary Alice, a good friend and neighbor.</p><p>Wherever you are, we hope you&#39;ve found peace.</p><p>To Mary Alice. - To Mary Alice.</p><p>Let&#39;s get this show on the road.</p><p>You guys, check out Mary Alice&#39;s clothes.</p><p>Size eight? Ha! She always told me she was a size six.</p><p>We found the skeleton in her closet.</p><p>Not quite, Gabrielle, not quite.</p><p>What&#39;s that? - A letter addressed to Mary Alice.</p><p>How ironic.</p><p>To have something I tried so desperately to keep secret,</p><p>treated so casually.</p><p>What are you doing? That&#39;s private.</p><p>It&#39;s open. What&#39;s the big deal?</p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. But check out the postmark.</p><p>Oh, my god. She got it the day she died.</p><p>Do you think this is why she...?</p><p>I&#39;m so sorry, girls.</p><p>I never wanted you to be burdened with this.</p><p>Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?</p><h2 id="dh-se01-e02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dh-se01-e02" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DH SE01 E02</h2><p>If Mary Alice was having some sort of crisis,</p><p>we&#39;d have known.</p><p>She lives 50 feet away, for god&#39;s sakes.</p><p>Gabby, the woman killed herlf.</p><p>Something must have been going on.</p><p>Every time I&#39;m around that man, he tries to grab my ass.</p><p>I made over $200,000 doing business with him last year.</p><p>If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.</p><p>Why aren&#39;t you happy?</p><p>Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.</p><p>What&#39;s that?</p><p>It&#39;s a letter addressed to Mary Alice.</p><p>Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?</p><p>An odd thing happens when we die.</p><p>Our senses vanish.</p><p>Taste, touch, smell, and sound</p><p>become a distant memory,</p><p>but our sight -- ah, our sight expands,</p><p>and we can suddenly see the world we&#39;ve left behind so clearly.</p><p>Of course, most of what&#39;s visible to the dead</p><p>could also be seen by the living,</p><p>if they&#39;d only take the time to look.</p><p>Like my friend Gabrielle.</p><p>I should have seen how unhappy she was,</p><p>but I didn&#39;t.</p><p>I only saw her clothes from Paris...</p><p>and her platinum jewelry...</p><p>and her brand-new diamond watch.</p><p>Had I looked closer,</p><p>I&#39;d have seen that Gabrielle was a drowning woman</p><p>desperately in search of a life raft.</p><p>Luckily for her, she found one.</p><p>Of course, Gabrielle only saw her young gardener</p><p>as a way to infuse her life with a little excitement.</p><p>But now she was about to discover</p><p>just how exciting her life could get.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>Come on, come on, come on! Hurry up! Let&#39;s go!</p><p>Where are the rest of my clothes?</p><p>I&#39;ll find them. Just get out.</p><p>Where?</p><p>Out the window. - What?</p><p>Go, go, go, go, go!</p><p>Hi, honey. You&#39;re home early.</p><p>My meeting got canceled.</p><p>Didn&#39;t you take a shower this morning?</p><p>I, uh, I just finished a workout.</p><p>Where&#39;s John?</p><p>John?</p><p>Yeah. That&#39;s his truck out front.</p><p>Gabrielle was panicked.</p><p>She knew if her husband discovered her secret,</p><p>she would feel the full force of his wrath.</p><p>Hey, Mr. Solis.</p><p>Hey, John, take care of that ficus yet?</p><p>I&#39;ll get to it as soon as I&#39;m done here. - All right.</p><p>But she was quickly reminded that...</p><p>What Carlos couldn&#39;t see...</p><p>Yeah, sure. No problem.</p><p>couldn&#39;t hurt her.</p><p>The peaceful facade of Wisteria Lane had recently been shattered,</p><p>first by my suicide...</p><p>and then by the discovery of a note among my belongings</p><p>that suggested a suspicious reason for my desperate act.</p><p>My friends gathered to discuss its implications.</p><p>I think we should give it to Paul.</p><p>He&#39;s still mourning, Susan.</p><p>He&#39;ll probably freak out.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter. She was his wife.</p><p>He deserves to have all the facts.</p><p>Well, we could do it gently.</p><p>We could tell him about it over coffee and pastry.</p><p>That would be fun.</p><p>&quot;Paul, we have proof your wife killed herself</p><p>over some deep, dark secret.</p><p>Another bear claw?&quot;</p><p>We could always call the police.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s just some sort of sick joke.</p><p>Well, if it was a joke, it was in very poor taste.</p><p>No, this was serious. I know it was.</p><p>We got to find out what was going on.</p><p>Let&#39;s say we do.</p><p>There&#39;s a chance we&#39;re not going to like what we find.</p><p>Well, isn&#39;t it worse to be in the dark?</p><p>I mean, imagining she did all these horrible things.</p><p>It&#39;s the age-old question, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>How much do we really want to know about our neighbors?</p><p>My friends were right to be concerned.</p><p>They knew that every family has its secrets,</p><p>and as my son and husband could have told them,</p><p>you need to think carefully before digging them up.</p><p>After talking for hours,</p><p>my friends still hadn&#39;t agreed on</p><p>what to do with the note.</p><p>So they decided to talk about it in the morning</p><p>after a good night&#39;s rest.</p><p>But no one could fall sleep that night.</p><p>They each kept thinking of my suicide</p><p>and how terribly alone I must have felt.</p><p>You see, loneliness was something</p><p>my friends understood all too well.</p><p>It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m up.</p><p>Good.</p><p>I have a question for you.</p><p>OK.</p><p>Do you remember when you proposed?</p><p>For god&#39;s sake --</p><p>We sat on Skyline Drive and drank a bottle of apple wine,</p><p>and when we finished it, you turned to me, and you said,</p><p>&quot;if you marry me, Bree Mason,</p><p>I promise to love you for the rest of my life.&quot;</p><p>And even though I was engaged to Ty Grant,</p><p>and even though my father didn&#39;t like you,</p><p>I said yes.</p><p>That was a long time ago.</p><p>You&#39;re going to cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer,</p><p>and we&#39;re going to find ourselves a marriage counselor.</p><p>Bree... - You promised.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Good. I&#39;m going to go, uh, make myself some warm milk.</p><p>Would you like something to drink?</p><p>Anything but apple wine.</p><p>Susan awoke that night alone and parched,</p><p>but as she gazed out her window,</p><p>she saw the tall drink of water she needed to quench her thirst.</p><p>&quot;Dear diary, Mike doesn&#39;t even know I&#39;m alive.&quot;</p><p>Shut up.</p><p>If you want to date him, you&#39;re going to have to ask him out.</p><p>I keep hoping he&#39;ll ask me out.</p><p>How&#39;s that going?</p><p>Shouldn&#39;t you be making brownies</p><p>for your nerdy friends?</p><p>I can&#39;t find the measuring cup. Have you seen it?</p><p>The measuring cup?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I -- well, it&#39;s -- it&#39;s got to be here somewhere.</p><p>Just keep looking.</p><p>I know you&#39;re awake.</p><p>I know you&#39;re a jerk.</p><p>Dinner with Tanaka ran long. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>You know, Carlos, I didn&#39;t marry you</p><p>so I could have dinner by myself six times a week.</p><p>You know how bored I was today?</p><p>I came this close to actually cleaning the house.</p><p>Don&#39;t be that way. I got you a gift.</p><p>Nope. No, no, no, no.</p><p>You&#39;re not going to buy your way out of this one.</p><p>It&#39;s a good gift.</p><p>Is that white gold?</p><p>Yeah. Put it on...</p><p>and then make love to me.</p><p>I&#39;m not in the mood.</p><p>But we could stay up and talk.</p><p>When a man buys a woman expensive jewelry,</p><p>there are many things he may want in return, for future reference,</p><p>conversation ain&#39;t one of them.</p><p>Hey, that was a joke. - Yeah, right.</p><p>What the hell is wrong with you? - Let go of me.</p><p>Hey, you&#39;ve been acting like a nightmare for a month. What&#39;s wrong?</p><p>I can&#39;t fix it unless you tell me.</p><p>It&#39;s not exciting anymore, Carlos.</p><p>So what am I supposed to do?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>Be the way you used to be.</p><p>Surprise me. Take my breath away.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Hey, Susan. - Mike.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong?</p><p>I didn&#39;t realize anybody was going to be out here.</p><p>I just sort of rolled out of bed.</p><p>I&#39;m sure you look fine.</p><p>Oh, Bongo, stop.</p><p>Sorry, uh... he scares easy.</p><p>No, it-- it&#39;s fine. I-I get it.</p><p>I didn&#39;t mean to disturb you.</p><p>I&#39;ll see you later.</p><p>Do you want to have dinner with me?</p><p>Just the two of us?</p><p>Well... and Julie.</p><p>It&#39;s a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighborhood,</p><p>we invite them over for a home-cooked meal.</p><p>Sort of a tradition.</p><p>I thought you were a lousy cook.</p><p>Well, I order take-out.</p><p>You invite &#39;em for home-cooking and give &#39;em take-out?</p><p>Yeah, ah, it&#39;s sort of a new tradition.</p><p>I&#39;m working out the kinks.</p><p>I&#39;ll tell you what. How about I cook?</p><p>You guys come over to my place.</p><p>Oh, great.</p><p>Friday night at six? - I&#39;ll be there.</p><p>Right. Come on.</p><p>Bye, Bongo.</p><p>Julie! Mike Delfino just invited us</p><p>to dinner Friday night.</p><p>He did? Cool.</p><p>But only I&#39;m going because you&#39;re</p><p>gonna come down with something serious</p><p>that requires bed rest and fluids.</p><p>Julie was glad Susan was rekindling her love life.</p><p>Of course, she was unaware of her</p><p>mother&#39;s recent track record with fire.</p><p>It&#39;s all gone. Everything my ex-husband</p><p>worked for all those years, gone.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about clothing.</p><p>I already started a collection from the neighborhood.</p><p>What? I don&#39;t want to wear other people&#39;s old crap.</p><p>Edie, you can be homeless or ungracious.</p><p>You really can&#39;t afford to be both.</p><p>That reminds me. My insurance check still hasn&#39;t come yet.</p><p>Could I stay with you a few more weeks?</p><p>Of course. What kind of christian would I be</p><p>if I denied shelter to a friend in need?</p><p>Oh, look. Here&#39;s something we can salvage.</p><p>Your measuring cup.</p><p>We can scrape of the burnt part and</p><p>it&#39;ll look good as new.</p><p>That&#39;s not my cup. Mine was plastic.</p><p>Well, how did it get in here?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. Who cares?</p><p>Now, would you put that down and start looking for jewelry?</p><p>Dr. Albert Goldfine was the most accomplished</p><p>marriage counselor in the city.</p><p>He had dealt with problems ranging from substance abuse...</p><p>...to infidelity...</p><p>...to domestic violence.</p><p>Yes, Dr. Goldfine thought he had seen it all.</p><p>And then he met the Van de Kamps.</p><p>Hi. I&#39;m Bree. And this is my husband Rex.</p><p>And I brought you some homemade potpourri.</p><p>The answer is yes.</p><p>You&#39;re about to make a fortune off us.</p><p>Ah, get off! - Boys!</p><p>Guys, I&#39;m begging you.</p><p>Sit in your seats.</p><p>I&#39;m not gonna tell you again. Buckle up.</p><p>I mean it, so help me...</p><p>Oh, shoot. Crap!</p><p>I was playing with it first!</p><p>License and registration, please.</p><p>Ma&#39;am, you know why I pulled you over?</p><p>I have a theory.</p><p>The kids should be sitting wearing seat belts.</p><p>I yelled at them. They never listen. It&#39;s very frustrating.</p><p>You have to find a way to control them.</p><p>After all, that&#39;s your job.</p><p>Though he&#39;d been a policeman for six years,</p><p>officer Hayes had never found himself</p><p>in a truly dangerous situation.</p><p>Then again, he had never before told</p><p>a woman how to raise her children.</p><p>Are you saying I&#39;m a bad mother?</p><p>Get back in your car, please.</p><p>I have no help. My husband&#39;s always away on business.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna have to ask you to step back now.</p><p>My babysitter joined the witness relocation program.</p><p>I haven&#39;t slept through the night...</p><p>...in six years - Ma&#39;am.</p><p>And for you to stand there and judge me...</p><p>Ok. I&#39;m not gonna give you a ticket.</p><p>I&#39;m just gonna let you off with a warning.</p><p>I accept your apology.</p><p>Mom! He&#39;s kicking me again!</p><p>Buckle up.</p><p>Mrs. Solis. - Hello, Jonathan.</p><p>Well, this is my room. Sorry about the mess.</p><p>Oh, uh, don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p>You just missed my mom.</p><p>On friday,she coaches my sister&#39;s soccer team.</p><p>Yes, I heard that.</p><p>John, we need to talk about what happened the other day.</p><p>Mr. Solis isn&#39;t catching on, is he?</p><p>No, no, he doesn&#39;t have a clue, god love him.</p><p>It&#39;s just I was thinking that when you come over to garden,</p><p>you might actually have to garden.</p><p>Great, you&#39;re breaking up with me.</p><p>In my own bedroom.</p><p>No, no. I&#39;m not dumping you.</p><p>Lately, you&#39;ve been the only thing keeping me going.</p><p>But we can&#39;t do it at my house anymore.</p><p>Oh, so then, where do you want to do it?</p><p>Well, what time does your mom get back from soccer practise?</p><p>Mrs. Solis!</p><p>Better hurry. We don&#39;t have much time.</p><p>And so there&#39;s just the four of us.</p><p>My older son, Andrew, is 16, Danielle is 15 and...</p><p>I don&#39;t need to see pictures. Bree,</p><p>you&#39;ve spent most of the hour</p><p>engaging in small talk.</p><p>Oh, have I ? - Yes.</p><p>Rex has been very vocal about his issues.</p><p>Don&#39;t you want to discuss your feelings about your marriage?</p><p>Um, doc...</p><p>This is the thing you got to know about Bree.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t like to talk about her feelings.</p><p>To be honest, it&#39;s hard to know if she has any.</p><p>Does she feel anger, rage, ecstasy?</p><p>Who knows?</p><p>She&#39;s always pleasant, and I can&#39;t</p><p>tell you how annoying that is.</p><p>Whatever she feels, it&#39;s so far below the surface,</p><p>no one can see it.</p><p>I feel like she&#39;s using all these...</p><p>Bree?</p><p>Bree? - What? I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>Would you like to respond to what Rex just said?</p><p>Oh, um... - Is there some truth there?</p><p>Do you use housework as a way to disengage emotionally?</p><p>Of course not!</p><p>This is great. I got tons of homework tonight.</p><p>It&#39;s easy to concentrate after sex.</p><p>I&#39;m glad I could help.</p><p>Education&#39;s very important.</p><p>Oh, I got something for you.</p><p>I was gonna give it to you next time I</p><p>mowed your lawn, but since you&#39;re here.</p><p>Oh, it&#39;s a rose. - It&#39;s not just any rose.</p><p>Look at all the petals. There&#39;s no flaws.</p><p>It&#39;s perfect. - Oh, John.</p><p>Just like you.</p><p>The truth hit her like a thunderbolt.</p><p>I spent days looking for just the right one.</p><p>I finally found it.</p><p>For John,</p><p>this was no longer a meaningless little affair.</p><p>Gabrielle could now clearly see</p><p>he was falling in love with her.</p><p>It&#39;s just beautiful.</p><p>I... I got to go.</p><p>Goodbye.</p><p>Hey, you. What are we having?</p><p>I talked to Julie and she suggested rib-eye steaks.</p><p>She said that&#39;s your favorite. - I love my steak.</p><p>Hi, Mike.</p><p>Susan.</p><p>Edie.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry about your house. How you holding up?</p><p>All right, I guess. Oh, is somebody having a party?</p><p>No, Susan&#39;s just throwing me</p><p>a traditional welcome dinner.</p><p>Only I&#39;m cooking. And having it at my house.</p><p>Traditional? Hm! I didn&#39;t get one.</p><p>Oh, it&#39;s a new tradition.</p><p>It won&#39;t be anything fancy. Just a little home cooking.</p><p>Mm. That sounds so good.</p><p>Susan suddenly had an awful</p><p>feeling in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>I&#39;ve been having nothing but fast food lately.</p><p>As if she was watching an accident in slow motion.</p><p>She knew it would happen, but was powerless to stop it.</p><p>Edie, would you like to join us for dinner?</p><p>Oh, that&#39;s so sweet. No, I don&#39;t</p><p>want to intrude. Three&#39;s a crowd.</p><p>No, it&#39;s not like that. I mean, Susan&#39;s bringing Julie.</p><p>It&#39;s not like that. The more the merrier.</p><p>Well, this&#39;ll be fun. - All right. Tomorrow night.</p><p>We&#39;ll eat at six. - Great.</p><p>Oh, and Susan... - Yeah?</p><p>This&#39;ll make up for the dinner that you never threw me.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Ta-ta.</p><p>Should I have told her we were having steak.</p><p>She&#39;s not a vegetarian or something?</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>No, Edie&#39;s definitely a carnivore.</p><p>Here&#39;s, um...</p><p>Here&#39;s what I pulled for Edie.</p><p>Most of the clothes aren&#39;t that stylish.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about it. Edie&#39;s a beggar now,</p><p>which means she can&#39;t be a chooser.</p><p>Of course, we don&#39;t have to add salt to the wound.</p><p>Listen, I was just getting dinner ready...</p><p>Say no more. I&#39;ll get out of your hair.</p><p>No, no.</p><p>By the way, was that you I saw getting pulled</p><p>over by a policeman?</p><p>Yeah, the boys were acting up in the car,</p><p>I couldn&#39;t get them to sit down.</p><p>Young boys can be so willful.</p><p>I try everything.</p><p>I scream. I threaten. I reason.</p><p>I beg. Nothing works.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because</p><p>they&#39;re too young and they don&#39;t understand,</p><p>or if they&#39;re just getting some perverse joy out of testing me.</p><p>My mother used to have the worst time with me in the car,</p><p>so one time when I was acting up,</p><p>she stopped and left me on the side of the road,</p><p>and she drove off.</p><p>You&#39;re kidding?</p><p>Oh, she came back immediately,</p><p>but I never misbehaved in the car again.</p><p>You should try that.</p><p>Mrs. Huber, I could never leave</p><p>my kids by the side of the road.</p><p>When it comes to discipline,</p><p>sometimes you must be creative.</p><p>My mother knew that. Smart lady.</p><p>Of course, she&#39;s in a home now.</p><p>And her mind has just turned to mush.</p><p>Well, like I said, I should go back and get dinner ready.</p><p>Oh, right, well... Goodbye.</p><p>Goodbye.</p><p>Susan, have you been able to find old clothes for Edie?</p><p>She has nothing to wear.</p><p>I thought that was the look she was going for.</p><p>Oh, Susan, Edie may be trash,</p><p>but she&#39;s still a human being.</p><p>Zach, is your dad home? I need to talk to him.</p><p>Hey, Paul, I hope I&#39;m not interrupting.</p><p>Actually, I was getting ready to go somewhere.</p><p>I just wanted to come by and say hello,</p><p>you know, see how you guys are doing.</p><p>We&#39;re trying to move on. It&#39;s been pretty tough.</p><p>I can only imagine.</p><p>Not knowing why Mary Alice...</p><p>Why what? - Why she did it.</p><p>Oh. Here, let me help you. - I&#39;ve got it. I&#39;ve got it.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry if I upset you.</p><p>Can I be frank?</p><p>Of course.</p><p>I don&#39;t care what her reasons were.</p><p>Maybe she was depressed, maybe she was bored.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p>She abandoned her husband and her son</p><p>and I&#39;ll never forgive her.</p><p>As I watched Susan, I couldn&#39;t help feeling sorry for her.</p><p>She wanted so much to know why I did it.</p><p>Why I killed myself.</p><p>It&#39;s not enough to want the truth.</p><p>You must know where to look for it.</p><p>And the truth is elusive</p><p>because it knows where to hide.</p><p>Hello, Julie, I talked to your mom</p><p>about donating some clothes for Edie.</p><p>She&#39;s at Mrs. Van De Kamp&#39;s,</p><p>but I&#39;ll see if she left some stuff upstairs.</p><p>Oh, Julie, I-I was, um, just admiring your new measuring cup.</p><p>Yeah, we&#39;ve lost ours. - Really?</p><p>So I couldn&#39;t find the clothes. Sorry.</p><p>That&#39;s ok.</p><p>If you want me to keep looking.</p><p>No. You&#39;ve done more than enough.</p><p>Truly.</p><p>Bree. Rex just called. He won&#39;t be able to meet you here today.</p><p>Apparently, there was an emergency at the hospital.</p><p>Oh, well, I wish he&#39;d called me.</p><p>He suggested perhaps you&#39;d like to meet with me by yourself.</p><p>You&#39;ve been very quiet in our joint sessions.</p><p>What?</p><p>Oh, oh, oh, no, thank you.</p><p>I have some things I need to do today.</p><p>Are you sure? - Uh, yeah, I&#39;m sure.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Dr. Goldfine, there is something you can do for me.</p><p>What&#39;s that? - Take off your coat.</p><p>So you&#39;re taking Julie on your dinner date with Mike?</p><p>Well, if Edie&#39;s gonna be there,</p><p>I&#39;ll need emotional support.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe she wormed her way in.</p><p>How did you let her do that?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. I was going to take her out at the knees,</p><p>but it all happened so fast.</p><p>Well, you know what you need to do.</p><p>You need to get there early,</p><p>spend a little time with Mike before the little barracuda gets there.</p><p>That&#39;s a good idea. Edie will get there at 5:45,</p><p>which means her breasts will arrive at 5:30,</p><p>so I should shoot for 5:00.</p><p>That a girl.</p><p>I&#39;m just going to take these upstairs.</p><p>I&#39;m going to keep my one little bag and go home.</p><p>That is a beautiful rose. Where did you get it?</p><p>Oh, John gave it to me.</p><p>John... your gardener, he gave you a rose?</p><p>Yes... I am having some new bushes planted outside,</p><p>and he gave me that as a color palette.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Sure is beautiful, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>Yes, it is.</p><p>I&#39;m sure Freud would not approve of this.</p><p>Oh, who cares what he thinks?</p><p>I took psychology in college.</p><p>We learned all about Freud.</p><p>A miserable human being.</p><p>What makes you say that?</p><p>Think about it.</p><p>He grew up in the late 1800s.</p><p>There were no appliances back then.</p><p>His mother had to do everything by hand,</p><p>just backbreaking work from sun up to sundown.</p><p>Not to mention the countless</p><p>other sacrifices she had to make</p><p>to take care of her family, and what does he do?</p><p>He becomes famous peddling a theory</p><p>that the problems of most adults</p><p>can be traced back to</p><p>something awful their mother has done.</p><p>She must&#39;ve felt so betrayed.</p><p>He saw how hard she worked.</p><p>He saw what she did for him.</p><p>Did he even ever think to say thank you?</p><p>I doubt it.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>Just so you know, many of Freud&#39;s</p><p>theories have been discredited.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Boys, I am not gonna tell you again. Sit.</p><p>I mean it. I am serious.</p><p>You guys are gonna be in so much trouble</p><p>if you don&#39;t sit back in those seats.</p><p>For the first time,</p><p>Lynette could see this was not the innocent play of children.</p><p>She was being challenged.</p><p>So she decided it was time to get creative.</p><p>Out! Can&#39;t behave,</p><p>you heard me, you cannot ride.</p><p>You, out, move it.</p><p>Where is she going?</p><p>Ok. Mommy&#39;s a genius.</p><p>Five, six, all right.</p><p>Uh, mommy&#39;ll be right back.</p><p>Boys? Boys?</p><p>Boys?!</p><p>Porter! Preston! Parker!</p><p>If you&#39;re hiding, you&#39;ve got to stop now,</p><p>cause mommy doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s funny!</p><p>Oh! excuse me.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m looking for my boys.</p><p>Three boys with red hair. Have you seen them?</p><p>Yeah. I also saw you drive away and leave them.</p><p>I know. I was just trying to scare them into behaving.</p><p>Did you see where they went?</p><p>Yeah, they&#39;re in my kitchen.</p><p>Listen, it seems to me that you</p><p>have some anger management issues.</p><p>I have four kids under six.</p><p>I absolutely have anger management issues.</p><p>I think you need to talk to somebody</p><p>because abandoning your children...</p><p>I didn&#39;t abandon them. I came back.</p><p>I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s not normal.</p><p>My kids aren&#39;t normal</p><p>and now I don&#39;t have time for this, lady, so --</p><p>Boys, get out here.</p><p>I don&#39;t think they should go anywhere</p><p>until you calm down.</p><p>Get in the car. - She&#39;s got cookies.</p><p>Bring them, we&#39;re leaving. - Stay put.</p><p>I don&#39;t think so. Oh! - Listen, lady...</p><p>Leave my mommy alone. - Let go of me.</p><p>What&#39;s the matter with you? - Son of bi... Ah!</p><p>Run, boys, run! - Come on!</p><p>Oh, crap. - Get back here.</p><p>Boys, you&#39;re gonna need to put on your...</p><p>Get back or I&#39;m gonna call social services.</p><p>Oh, my god! Carlos, what have you done?</p><p>I saw it when I drove by the dealership.</p><p>I thought Gabrielle will look beautiful in this.</p><p>Carlos!</p><p>It cost me an arm and a leg.</p><p>It&#39;s got GPS navigation, 200 watt stereo system...</p><p>It is beautiful.</p><p>So did I take your breath away?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Is it the best gift you&#39;ve ever gotten?</p><p>Gabrielle could see what this gesture had cost Carlos,</p><p>so she responded the only way she knew how.</p><p>She had a feeling the truth would&#39;ve</p><p>been lost on her husband anyway.</p><p>After all, it&#39;s the rare man who understands the value</p><p>of a single perfect rose.</p><p>Susan. - I hope you don&#39;t mind.</p><p>I came by early to help you set up.</p><p>Oh, um... - Hey, Susan.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry, we have everything under control.</p><p>Bongo! I don&#39;t know why he barks at you.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t take it personally.</p><p>Dogs are very sensitive.</p><p>What&#39;s up, Bongo?</p><p>You never know what freaks them out, huh?</p><p>In the distance, Susan thought she heard a bell ring.</p><p>Is it a strange noise?</p><p>What is it? A weird smell?</p><p>Round one...had started.</p><p>All I&#39;m saying is</p><p>this whole it takes two to mess</p><p>up a marriage theory is bull.</p><p>The problems that we have are because of her.</p><p>That is not true, Rex.</p><p>What have I been doing for the past</p><p>20 years that&#39;s been so awful?</p><p>You&#39;re not saying anything because</p><p>I&#39;ve been a great husband.</p><p>And it kills you to admit that.</p><p>Rex, I&#39;m curious.</p><p>Do you ever acknowledge the benefits of living with Bree?</p><p>Huh? - By your own admission,</p><p>your home&#39;s always clean,</p><p>your clothes always freshly pressed,</p><p>sounds like a wonderful cook,</p><p>despite her flaws,</p><p>do you ever remember to say thank you?</p><p>Thank you? - Yes.</p><p>Bongo! Get down! Down!</p><p>Go away. - Down. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>So who&#39;s the guy that lives across from Mrs. Huber again?</p><p>That&#39;s Mr. Mullen. If he invites you in,</p><p>you have to meet all of his pets.</p><p>That&#39;s ok. I love animals.</p><p>He&#39;s a taxidermist.</p><p>Oh, ok, thanks for the warning.</p><p>Isn&#39;t Mr. Mullen&#39;s brother your divorce attorney?</p><p>Uh, yes, yes, he was.</p><p>Can I say something?</p><p>In my heart, I still believe that you</p><p>and Karl are gonna get back together.</p><p>Really? - Oh, yeah.</p><p>I&#39;ve never seen two people more in love.</p><p>She&#39;s never gonna find that kind of</p><p>chemistry with another man. Never.</p><p>It was everything Susan could do to keep a smile on her face.</p><p>Round two was underway,</p><p>and she was already taking a beating.</p><p>You know, Mrs. Britt...</p><p>What Edie hadn&#39;t counted on...</p><p>I always liked...</p><p>Susan had someone in her corner.</p><p>Mr. Rothwell, your fourth husband.</p><p>He was my second husband. I&#39;ve only been married twice.</p><p>Twice? You weren&#39;t married to the tattooed</p><p>guy they took away in handcuffs?</p><p>No, Julie, she wasn&#39;t married to Javier.</p><p>That was just one of her special friends.</p><p>I think we should change the subject.</p><p>Unless you want to keep talking about it.</p><p>Bongo, get down. - Wait.</p><p>Let me show you something. - He loves that gravy.</p><p>Come. While you were in there tossing a salad,</p><p>I taught him something.</p><p>Up. Oh...</p><p>Susan was furious with Edie</p><p>for using a dog to ingratiate herself with its owner.</p><p>She was also furious with Mike for not</p><p>seing through this blatant maneuver.</p><p>But mostly...</p><p>...I&#39;m gonna get the desserts.</p><p>...She was furious with herself for not having thought of it first.</p><p>I can barely get him to sit.</p><p>Best dog ever. Yes, you are.</p><p>I&#39;ve never seen him walk on two legs.</p><p>He knows who to come to.</p><p>Here&#39;s your dessert.</p><p>Thank you. Mike, this looks yummy.</p><p>Oh, look at that. Looks like bongo&#39;s</p><p>finally warming up to Susan.</p><p>Ooh, we just got off on the wrong foot.</p><p>We&#39;re best buddies now.</p><p>Oh, what a good boy!</p><p>Bango, are you ok? - What&#39;s wrong with him?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>I&#39;ve never heard him make that sound.</p><p>You ok, fella? - Mom?</p><p>You all right?</p><p>Where is your earring?</p><p>You ok?</p><p>Call the vet, the number&#39;s on the fridge.</p><p>Tell him I&#39;ll be right there.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry.</p><p>I&#39;ll stay here and get everything cleaned up.</p><p>Thanks, Edie.</p><p>Is there anything I can do?</p><p>No.</p><p>How&#39;s Bongo doing?</p><p>I&#39;m waiting to see if they&#39;ll have to operate.</p><p>Oh, god!</p><p>I stopped and I got this for...</p><p>I am just so sorry for this.</p><p>I&#39;m really sorry I snapped at you. I just...</p><p>Oh, no, it&#39;s ok. - Good news.</p><p>We won&#39;t have to do surgery. - Oh, that&#39;s great.</p><p>We&#39;ve given him something to help pass the earring.</p><p>When he does, would you like us to retrieve it for you?</p><p>I&#39;m gonna say no.</p><p>Ok. You should be able to take him home in about an hour.</p><p>Wow. You must be so relieved.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, I was just really worried.</p><p>It was your dog. I get it.</p><p>Actually, he was my wife&#39;s dog,</p><p>one of the last thing&#39;s she said to</p><p>me in the hospital before she died</p><p>was to be sure I looked after</p><p>him and I promised her I would.</p><p>And just like that,</p><p>Susan could suddenly see something she&#39;d never seen before.</p><p>He, uh, meant so much to her.</p><p>Mike Delfino was still in love with his late wife.</p><p>And if something had happened,</p><p>I would&#39;ve felt like I&#39;d failed her.</p><p>I know that sounds stupid, but...</p><p>And she knew right then,</p><p>neither she nor Edie would be laying</p><p>claim to his heart any time soon.</p><p>No, it doesn&#39;t. Not at all.</p><p>So she decided, for now, she could</p><p>settle for just being his friend.</p><p>This is for you.</p><p>Well, for Bongo. You give it to him.</p><p>Yes, as I look back at the world I left behind,</p><p>it&#39;s all so clear to me.</p><p>The beauty that waits to be unveiled.</p><p>The mysteries that long to be uncovered</p><p>But people so rarely stop to take a look.</p><p>They just keep moving.</p><p>It&#39;s a shame, really.</p><p>There&#39;s so much to see</p><h2 id="dh-se01-e03" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dh-se01-e03" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DH SE01 E03</h2><p>She was his wife.</p><p>He deserves to have all the facts.</p><p>She abandoned her husband and her son and I&#39;ll never forgive her.</p><p>It&#39;s the age-old question,</p><p>how much do we want to know about our neighbors?</p><p>You gonna cancel the meeting with the divorce lawyer.</p><p>We&#39;ll find a marriage councilor.</p><p>I&#39;m Mike Deifino.</p><p>Susan Mayer. I live across the street.</p><p>If you wanna dating him,</p><p>you&#39;re gonna have to ask him out.</p><p>I keep hoping he&#39;ll ask me out.</p><p>I really hate the way you talk to me.</p><p>I really hate that I spent $15,000 on your diamond necklace,</p><p>but I&#39;m learning to deal with it.</p><p>Do you love him? - I do.</p><p>So then why are we here? Why are we doing this?</p><p>Because I don&#39;t want to wake up one morning,</p><p>With a sudden urge to blow my brains out.</p><p>After I died,</p><p>I began to surrender the parts of</p><p>myself that were no longer necessary.</p><p>My desires, beliefs, ambitions, doubts --</p><p>every trace of my humanity was discarded.</p><p>I discovered when moving through eternity,</p><p>it helps to travel lightly.</p><p>In fact, I held on to only one thing</p><p>my memory.</p><p>It&#39;s astonishing to look back on the world I left behind</p><p>I remember it all -- every single detail.</p><p>Like my friend Bree Van de Kamp.</p><p>I remember the easy confidence of her smile,</p><p>the gentle elegance of her hands,</p><p>the refined warmth of her voice.</p><p>But what I remember most about Bree</p><p>Rex, wasn&#39;t that lovely --</p><p>Was the look of fear in her eyes.</p><p>Bree had started to realize her world was unraveling,</p><p>and for a woman who despised loose ends,</p><p>that was unacceptable.</p><p>Rex. Rex. You need to get up.</p><p>It&#39;s not even light out.</p><p>Please hurry.</p><p>If the kids see you sleeping down here,</p><p>they&#39;re going to start asking questions.</p><p>Let &#39;em ask. I don&#39;t care anymore.</p><p>Well, I care.</p><p>They don&#39;t need to be burden with our marital problems</p><p>While we&#39;re working things out, the least</p><p>we can do is try to keep up appearances.</p><p>Oh, yeah. Appearances.</p><p>I keep forgetting about appearances.</p><p>Oh, Rex, you look so tired.</p><p>I didn&#39;t sleep.</p><p>This damn thing is so uncomfortable.</p><p>Well, why don&#39;t you move back upstairs and sleep in our bed?</p><p>We&#39;re in marriage counseling, Bree.</p><p>I think that would confuse things.</p><p>It&#39;s just--</p><p>I miss you.</p><p>I know you do.</p><p>Of course, if I don&#39;t find out start</p><p>getting some sleep, pretty soon</p><p>I&#39;ll be forced to move back upstairs out of sure exhaustion.</p><p>Yes, Bree was afraid of many things,</p><p>but if there was one thing she wasn&#39;t afraid of...</p><p>it was a challenge.</p><p>The day on Wisteria Lane began like any other.</p><p>With a cup of coffee and the moring paper.</p><p>Just give me a second....</p><p>And while Lynette read the business section.</p><p>And Gabrielle studied the fall collections</p><p>And Bree searched for decorating ideas</p><p>Susan scanned the front page and saw something</p><p>that caught her eye</p><p>What&#39;s about time.</p><p>Be nice. I come bearing snacks.</p><p>Lynette, these cards are sticky</p><p>I know. Preston used the three of diamonds</p><p>to took scoop jam out of the jar.</p><p>Gorgeous, thankful we have 49 cards to play with.</p><p>Hello. Sorry I&#39;m late.</p><p>So, Susan and I was just telling the girls,</p><p>I want to throw a dinner party</p><p>Really? - Yes.</p><p>Well how long have we all lived on this street</p><p>we&#39;ve never done a big group thing</p><p>I think it&#39;s a great idea</p><p>Paul never likes to have people over</p><p>but the heck with him I&#39;m doing it.</p><p>So when is this shindig?</p><p>How about a month from tonight?</p><p>That would be the 16th. Good for everyone?</p><p>Works for me. Should we all make something?</p><p>Oh, no. This is my party.</p><p>I&#39;ve been wanting to have everyone over for years.</p><p>I&#39;m so happy we&#39;re finally doing this.</p><p>It&#39;s gonna be so much fun.</p><p>I know. Her dinner.</p><p>How could we have all forgotten about this?</p><p>We didn&#39;t exactly forget, it&#39;s just usually</p><p>when the hostess dies the party&#39;s off.</p><p>Lynette</p><p>I&#39;m not being flip. I&#39;m just pointing out a reality.</p><p>Mary Alice was so excited about it.</p><p>It&#39;s so sad.</p><p>I think we should go through with it.</p><p>Really? Wouldn&#39;t that be in poor taste?</p><p>No. It&#39;s sort of a way to honor Mary Alice.</p><p>It was so important to her</p><p>We could all use a fun night.</p><p>Well, good, because I have some new flour</p><p>that I have been just dying to show off.</p><p>Lynette?</p><p>I&#39;m in. - I&#39;ll make braised lamb shanks.</p><p>I&#39;m still in.</p><p>So how many I will be cooking for?</p><p>Seven. Three couples and Susan. Does that sound right?</p><p>No, it sounds very, very wrong.</p><p>Is there somebody you&#39;d like to invite?</p><p>I have an idea.</p><p>A dinner party.</p><p>Honey, I may be working late.</p><p>The Dillman proposal&#39;s a complete mess.</p><p>No, no, you promised to be home every night this week.</p><p>I&#39;ll try but I can&#39;t guarantee anything.</p><p>This is business.</p><p>Says the prince as he rides off into the sunset.</p><p>Boy the movies ever get that wrong.</p><p>You know what your problem is?</p><p>You&#39;re very tense.</p><p>You should go to a spa or go shopping.</p><p>Find a way to relax.</p><p>Hello?</p><p>Where are you?</p><p>Algebra.</p><p>You free at 4:00?</p><p>I&#39;m not sure. I got track after school.</p><p>Well, get here as fast as you can.</p><p>My husband says I need to relax.</p><p>You, uh, want me to keep my gym clothes on like last time?</p><p>If you would, please.</p><p>A dinner party?</p><p>Yeah, it&#39;ll be fun.</p><p>Bree&#39;s cooking, everyone&#39;s coming.</p><p>You know what? I haven&#39;t even had</p><p>a chance to unpack yet, honey.</p><p>I just, uh, I just need to chill out for the next few days.</p><p>Oh, Tom.</p><p>There&#39;ll be liquor and hors d&#39;oeuvres and</p><p>grownups without children and -- and silverware.</p><p>Remember silverware?</p><p>Honey, can you take this in for me?</p><p>Have you heard anything I just said?</p><p>Yeah, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m just -- I&#39;m wiped out.</p><p>Three cities in six days -- my head is just pounding.</p><p>I&#39;m not ready for a dinner party.</p><p>I already got a sitter.</p><p>Can you cancel her?</p><p>Please? Look, let&#39;s just stay in tomorrow night.</p><p>We can get a bottle of wine and rent a video,</p><p>and-I just want to hang out with my best gal.</p><p>That&#39;s all.</p><p>I was looking so forward to a night out.</p><p>I know, sweetie, I&#39;m sorry, but...</p><p>I&#39;m beat.</p><p>I mean, do you remember what it</p><p>was like to work a 60-hour week?</p><p>A dinner party?</p><p>Do I have to go?</p><p>Well, given that we&#39;re hosting it, I&#39;d say so.</p><p>By the way, you won&#39;t be drinking at this party.</p><p>Why is that?</p><p>Because when you drink, you get chatty.</p><p>No one needs to know that we&#39;re seeing Dr. Goldfine.</p><p>You know, if you spent half as much time working</p><p>on our problems as you do covering them --</p><p>Not a drop.</p><p>You know, this -- this is ridiculous.</p><p>And this whole thing about us taking tennis lessons?</p><p>Well, the nurses at your office may start wondering</p><p>why you&#39;re disappearing three times a week.</p><p>Tennis lessons are a plausible alibi.</p><p>All right so, these tennis lessons we&#39;re taking --</p><p>how are we doing?</p><p>My backhand&#39;s improving immensely,</p><p>but you&#39;re still having problems with your serve.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>A dinner party?</p><p>It&#39;s tomorrow night, so if you could</p><p>just keep Julie an extra day.</p><p>Fine, but that&#39;s all. Brandi and I leave</p><p>sunday for a week up at the cabin.</p><p>What cabin?</p><p>Brandi wanted some place where we could get away.</p><p>Escrow just closed yesterday.</p><p>You can afford a cabin,</p><p>but you can&#39;t scrape up child support?</p><p>The check is in the mail.</p><p>Oh. No, it&#39;s not.</p><p>I found my dental guard. I&#39;m ready.</p><p>Stop fighting.</p><p>We are being as nice as we possibly can to one another.</p><p>Like I said, stop fighting.</p><p>Excuse me, Brandi.</p><p>Do you mind?</p><p>Oh, okay.</p><p>Wait. Susan, you&#39;re right there. You can pick it up.</p><p>I could, but she&#39;s the one who threw it.</p><p>Come on. Don&#39;t be petulant.</p><p>Just pick up the stupid can.</p><p>No.</p><p>I can pick it up.</p><p>Honey, stay out of this.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>This is so typical.</p><p>Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Was that petulant, too?</p><p>You know what? You can pick up the damn can yourself.</p><p>Yeah, well, you just go to hell.</p><p>You want me to pick it up?</p><p>Mrs. Warmington said she looked for</p><p>mom&#39;s obituary and couldn&#39;t find it.</p><p>Did you put one in?</p><p>I&#39;ve had other things on my mind, Zack.</p><p>But how could you not do that?</p><p>People are going to think we didn&#39;t care about her.</p><p>I doubt people will give it much thought.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p>You never talk about her.</p><p>She hasn&#39;t even been dead a month,</p><p>and it&#39;s like you&#39;ve totally forgotten she ever existed.</p><p>It&#39;s a little early for this kind of talk.</p><p>Maybe when you die,</p><p>I won&#39;t put in an obituary.</p><p>That will be your choice to make.</p><p>Assuming you outlive me.</p><p>Mom, it&#39;s no big deal.</p><p>Carlos and I are driving in for the baptism.</p><p>Problem solved.</p><p>Okay, fine.</p><p>You go with aunt Maria,</p><p>and I will take Nana to church.</p><p>Take your clothes off.</p><p>Okay. I got to go, mom.</p><p>Yes, right now.</p><p>Okay, you can give me directions later. Bye.</p><p>Hi. How was school?</p><p>Got an a-minus on my biology exam.</p><p>You did?</p><p>Well, let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve learned.</p><p>Who&#39;s that?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>Hey, you!</p><p>So did Mike say anything?</p><p>No, but, god, you should have seen the look on his face.</p><p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that bad.</p><p>I mean, he&#39;s coming to the party, right?</p><p>I left three messages.</p><p>Oh, he&#39;s not going to come. Big surprise.</p><p>I did everything but foam at the mouth.</p><p>God, I hate when I get that way.</p><p>It&#39;s like every time I get within 10 feet</p><p>of Carl, I just become this monster.</p><p>You know what? It&#39;s not going to change until</p><p>you resolve your issues with that man.</p><p>What, you mean forgive him?</p><p>You know, I&#39;ve lived with this bitterness</p><p>so long, I think I&#39;d be lonely without it.</p><p>Honey, get a pet.</p><p>See ya.</p><p>Son of a - It&#39;s a business meeting.</p><p>It&#39;s a frat party.</p><p>Regional manager, corporate manager, head of sales.</p><p>Margarita, cigar, sombrero.</p><p>Honey, what do you want me to do, sit around</p><p>the hotel the whole time watching cable?</p><p>No. But when I say,</p><p>&quot;we&#39;ve been invited to a party,&quot;</p><p>Don&#39;t whine about your exhausting 60-hour week.</p><p>Put on your dancin&#39; shoes and take the</p><p>mother of your children out for a good time.</p><p>Fine. You know what? You&#39;re right.</p><p>Let&#39;s go to that party.</p><p>I can&#39;t. I already canceled the sitter.</p><p>Okay, well, we&#39;ll throw the next one.</p><p>Throw a dinner party?</p><p>I don&#39;t even have time to wash my face.</p><p>No, you know what?</p><p>I&#39;m going to go to this one.</p><p>You can stay home and babysit the kids.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>I can handle that.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Gabrielle spent her morning searching</p><p>for the mysterious little girl.</p><p>Sadly for her,</p><p>the mystery was solved a bit too quickly.</p><p>What&#39;s going on?</p><p>Have you met Ashley?</p><p>Found it!</p><p>Babe, this is Sheila Bukowski, our new neighbor.</p><p>They just moved into the miller&#39;s old house.</p><p>My daughter left her ball in your yard. I&#39;m so sorry.</p><p>Oh, oh, no -- no problem.</p><p>Nice to meet you, Ashley.</p><p>She&#39;s shy. She doesn&#39;t say much.</p><p>Yeah, but I can see her little mind working away.</p><p>Nice meeting you.</p><p>Come on, Ashley.</p><p>Private sessions?</p><p>I don&#39;t understand. Why do we need private sessions?</p><p>Private sessions allow us to work on</p><p>the personal issues of both partners.</p><p>Oh, well, I don&#39;t have any personal issues.</p><p>My only issue is that my husband wants to leave me,</p><p>and how can I work on that if he&#39;s not in the room?</p><p>There are things I need to discuss with</p><p>Dr. Goldfine, and I can&#39;t have you there.</p><p>Why?</p><p>I&#39;m your wife. You can say anything in front of me.</p><p>All we need is a few more sessions, and I&#39;m sure we can --</p><p>Damn it, Bree,</p><p>a few more sessions isn&#39;t going to fix us.</p><p>This is bigger than that.</p><p>Why don&#39;t we do it this way?</p><p>Rex, you can take the first half-hour.</p><p>Bree, you can take the second.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>Oh, and, doctor,</p><p>if what he&#39;s about to discuss has anything to do with</p><p>adultery, prostitution, or internet pornography,</p><p>I would really appreciate you taking a moral hard line.</p><p>Hi, Ashley.</p><p>Remember me? We -- we met earlier.</p><p>Aren&#39;t you the little artist?</p><p>What are those -- flamingos?</p><p>No.</p><p>Well, they&#39;re very pretty.</p><p>It almost looks like they&#39;re kissing.</p><p>Funny thing about kissing --</p><p>It&#39;s not just for husbands and wives.</p><p>Sometimes we kiss our mom or our grandpa.</p><p>Sometimes we even kiss our dog. Ha ha.</p><p>Sometimes we even kiss people who are just our friends,</p><p>kind of like a high-five on the lips. Right?</p><p>Hey, Ash,</p><p>I was at the mall, and I saw this.</p><p>I thought you might like it.</p><p>She&#39;s Hawaiian.</p><p>Her name is princess Kahalua,</p><p>and I think it means &quot;little waterfall,&quot;</p><p>or &quot;big pond&quot; or something.</p><p>So we&#39;re good, right?</p><p>Well, you enjoy your new little friend,</p><p>and if there&#39;s anything else you need, you just let me know.</p><p>What I&#39;d really like</p><p>is a bike.</p><p>Where did you find that?</p><p>She used this to kill herself.</p><p>Why would you keep it?</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because I thought we might need it someday.</p><p>For what?</p><p>Protection.</p><p>I want to talk about mom.</p><p>You need to take your medication.</p><p>We are going to talk about mom.</p><p>Hello, Zack.</p><p>I hope this isn&#39;t a bad time.</p><p>What can I do for you, Mrs. Van de Kamp?</p><p>Well, I wanted to invite you and your</p><p>father to a dinner party tomorrow night.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure where he is right now.</p><p>Oh. Well, I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s such late notice, but, well,</p><p>we weren&#39;t sure that you and your father were</p><p>ready for any kind of social engagement yet,</p><p>but, we&#39;re sort of throwing it in your mother&#39;s honor.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Yes, it&#39;s just going to be a casual night with the gang.</p><p>We&#39;re going to eat and tell fun stories about your mom.</p><p>Zack... Are you okay?</p><p>Hello, Bree.</p><p>Oh, hi, Paul. I was just --</p><p>I heard.</p><p>Thank you, but we already have plans for tomorrow.</p><p>Oh. That&#39;s too bad.</p><p>Well, I should go.</p><p>Thank you, Mrs. Van de Kamp.</p><p>For what, Zack?</p><p>Remembering my mom.</p><p>That night, Paul gave his son something</p><p>to calm his nerves,</p><p>And the next day, Gabrielle calmed her own nerves</p><p>by giving something to her new best friend.</p><p>Here you go.</p><p>Top of the line, 3-speed, aluminum frame,</p><p>handlebar ribbons, and a bell,</p><p>and you&#39;ll notice it&#39;s royal blue</p><p>to match your pretty little eyes.</p><p>My eyes are green.</p><p>Yeah, well, you&#39;ll be cruising so fast</p><p>on this, no one will even notice.</p><p>It&#39;s all yours, hon.</p><p>Have fun.</p><p>What? What&#39;s wrong?</p><p>I don&#39;t know how to ride a bike.</p><p>What?</p><p>Well, then, why did you ask for one?</p><p>Why can&#39;t you show me?</p><p>Sure, one of these days.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong with now?</p><p>After her talk with Lynette,</p><p>Susan decided to take a look at her old photo album,</p><p>and she began to see herself in a whole new light,</p><p>and the picture wasn&#39;t flattering.</p><p>Yeah, you got Karl. Leave a message.</p><p>Hey, Karl, it&#39;s me.</p><p>I was hoping you&#39;d be there.</p><p>Um, listen, we need to talk,</p><p>so maybe when you drop Julie off tomorrow,</p><p>we could have a moment.</p><p>It&#39;s important.</p><p>Give my best to...</p><p>Brandi.</p><p>Call me.</p><p>Susan was proud of herself.</p><p>She was finally ready to let go of her anger.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>The boys will be hungry at 5:30,</p><p>so put the fish sticks in the toaster oven at 5:00.</p><p>For half an hour. Honey, I know.</p><p>This is the third time you&#39;ve told me.</p><p>Well, if the food&#39;s late, god help you.</p><p>Beautiful, I don&#39;t need a pamphlet.</p><p>It&#39;s not brain surgery.</p><p>They&#39;re just kids, for god sake.</p><p>Preston, would you come here?</p><p>Sweetie,</p><p>you know our rule about eating cookies, right?</p><p>Yeah, we can&#39;t have them after 5:00,</p><p>cause sugar makes us hyper.</p><p>Yeah, but tonight, anything goes.</p><p>Make sure you share with your brothers.</p><p>Thanks, mom.</p><p>Don&#39;t look at your feet. Don&#39;t look at your feet.</p><p>Look at the road. Look at the road. Good.</p><p>Find your balance. Find your balance.</p><p>Okay, it&#39;s all you. It&#39;s all you! you&#39;re doing great!</p><p>Okay, stay to the right. Watch the car.</p><p>Watch the car! Watch the car!</p><p>Oh! Are you okay?</p><p>Yeah. Let&#39;s go again.</p><p>Oh, honey, these heels don&#39;t have another block in them.</p><p>What about tomorrow?</p><p>Well, you won&#39;t be around tomorrow, &#39;cause you have school.</p><p>I&#39;m homeschooled.</p><p>I&#39;m always around.</p><p>It was in that moment that Gabrielle</p><p>realized this ride was far from over.</p><p>I&#39;m coming!</p><p>Karl, what are you doing here? I asked you to come tomorrow.</p><p>You said you wanted to talk. It sounded important.</p><p>Tomorrow. I&#39;m in a towel.</p><p>We were married 14 years.</p><p>I know what&#39;s under there. Come on.</p><p>I&#39;m not really ready for this.</p><p>I was going to have a whole speech prepared.</p><p>Brandi and I have plans tomorrow.</p><p>I suggest you wing it.</p><p>Um, okay.</p><p>Here&#39;s the thing, Karl --</p><p>I was thinking about what happened</p><p>in the driveway yesterday,</p><p>and I-I just don&#39;t want to --</p><p>I don&#39;t want to live like that.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be that kind of person,</p><p>and I just thought if the two of us,</p><p>you know, if we had a nice, calm --</p><p>I need an apology, Karl.</p><p>A what?</p><p>An apology for the way you ended our marriage.</p><p>You never took any responsibility for your behavior.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what to say, Susan.</p><p>The heart wants what it wants.</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>I fell in love.</p><p>While you were married to someone else.</p><p>The heart wants what it wants.</p><p>Yeah, well, my heart wants to hurt you,</p><p>But I can control myself.</p><p>I-I don&#39;t want to go back to that ugly place, really,</p><p>and if you do, I suggest that you get some help.</p><p>You know what?</p><p>I don&#39;t need an apology.</p><p>I don&#39;t need anything from you.</p><p>You&#39;re humiliating yourself.</p><p>No, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s been humiliated, Karl.</p><p>Why don&#39;t you see that?</p><p>You walked out on your family.</p><p>People think you&#39;re scum, not me,</p><p>so worry about yourself. I&#39;m okay with me.</p><p>I can walk down the street and hold my head high.</p><p>As the sun slowly settled on Wisteria Lane,</p><p>an unsettled Susan racked her brain</p><p>to find a way into her own house.</p><p>Lying naked in her shrubs,</p><p>it occurred to Susan this could be the</p><p>most humiliating moment of her life.</p><p>Susan?</p><p>She was wrong.</p><p>Uh, whatcha doing?</p><p>Locked myself out...</p><p>naked.</p><p>And then I fell.</p><p>So how are you?</p><p>I just got back.</p><p>I&#39;ve been gone all day,</p><p>and I got your messages about dinner,</p><p>and, um, I would love to come if that invite still stands.</p><p>It&#39;s a date.</p><p>All right. I, um...</p><p>assume the dress is casual.</p><p>Yeah. It&#39;s -- it&#39;s casual.</p><p>Thanks for helping me break in.</p><p>Do you think it&#39;ll be hard to replace that screen?</p><p>It depends.</p><p>If you nail it in yourself, you might want to wear gloves...</p><p>Or pants. Pants wouldn&#39;t hurt.</p><p>Okay, I know what just happened is funny in theory,</p><p>but I&#39;m nowhere near ready to laugh about it,</p><p>so please, no jokes.</p><p>Hey, where have you two been?</p><p>Uh, Susan had a problem finding something to wear.</p><p>Oh, is that the kind of thing you meant?</p><p>Pretty much.</p><p>The kids are bouncing off the walls? Huh.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m sure you can figure a way to put them to bed, Tom.</p><p>I mean, for god sakes, Tom, they&#39;re just kids.</p><p>Hey. Are you okay?</p><p>Yes, I-I went jogging today,</p><p>and I think I just pushed myself too hard.</p><p>Oh, you&#39;re probably not wearing the right shoes.</p><p>Yea, that thought did cross my mind.</p><p>So Gabrielle says that you and Bree are</p><p>taking lessons three times a week.</p><p>I&#39;m actually thinking about playing again.</p><p>I mean, it&#39;s such great exercise.</p><p>Mm. That it is.</p><p>And my drop shot could use a serious tune-up.</p><p>Think you can give me the number of your pro?</p><p>Yeah. I&#39;ll, uh, I&#39;ll give it to you later.</p><p>Well, what club does he work out of?</p><p>W-We&#39;re not really taking tennis lessons, Carlos.</p><p>You&#39;re not?</p><p>That&#39;s a story</p><p>Bree concocted to cover the fact that</p><p>we&#39;re seeing a marriage counselor.</p><p>Bree -- Bree...</p><p>He wouldn&#39;t stop asking about the tennis pro.</p><p>Bree and I are in marriage counseling.</p><p>Everyone knows our secret now.</p><p>Did the sky fall?</p><p>Has your life come crashing down?</p><p>If everybody would please take your seats,</p><p>dinner is served.</p><p>With the winds from the northwest at 4 miles per hour,</p><p>it&#39;s currently 55 degrees.</p><p>Now we go to rich... live on the scene in Westbrook.</p><p>A grisly discovery was made today in Westbrook</p><p>when a chest was found in Rockwater Lake,</p><p>discovered by a local area businessman and</p><p>his grandson while they were fishing.</p><p>Investigators recovered a wooden chest</p><p>containing what appears to be human remains.</p><p>Now, a police spokesman says the body was --</p><p>Okay, I got to break the ice here.</p><p>So you&#39;re in counseling. Big deal.</p><p>You want humiliation?</p><p>I&#39;ll give you humiliation.</p><p>I locked myself out of my house</p><p>stark naked and got caught by Mike.</p><p>Oh, my god. When did this happen?</p><p>Today, right before the party.</p><p>What can I say? Right place, right time.</p><p>I think I can top that. Try getting thrown</p><p>out of Disneyland for lewd behavior.</p><p>What? When was this?</p><p>When Tom and I were first married,</p><p>things got a little out of hand on Mr. Toad&#39;s Wild Ride.</p><p>You&#39;re kidding.</p><p>No. We got perp walked down main street, USA.</p><p>Well, since we&#39;re doing true confessions,</p><p>Carlos and I once broke a waterbed in Cancoon.</p><p>How&#39;d you manage that?</p><p>Well, he used to have a thing for spiked heels.</p><p>I&#39;d just like to make it clear -- she was wearing them.</p><p>Rex cries after he ejaculates.</p><p>You think we left too early?</p><p>I was thinking we left too late.</p><p>So is, uh, Rex gone for good?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>God, I hope not.</p><p>I mean, they&#39;ve always been wound a little tight,</p><p>but I&#39;ve never seen them like that.</p><p>Then again, who am I to judge?</p><p>You mean people who live in glass</p><p>houses shouldn&#39;t throw soda cans?</p><p>Okay, you have got to know that I</p><p>only get that angry around Karl.</p><p>He just treated me so badly at the end.</p><p>I haven&#39;t been able to get past it.</p><p>Well, maybe he did you a big favor.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>Let&#39;s look at Karl as a starter marriage</p><p>you know, boot camp.</p><p>Preparing you for something better next time.</p><p>Listen, Mike...</p><p>About the whole seeing me naked thing, I...</p><p>I don&#39;t -- I just want to thank you for</p><p>being such a... perfect gentleman.</p><p>Oh, I wasn&#39;t a perfect gentleman.</p><p>I might have snuck a peek.</p><p>Good night.</p><p>And, um, for what it&#39;s worth...</p><p>Wow.</p><p>How was your night?</p><p>We are raising little terrorists.</p><p>You know that, don&#39;t you?</p><p>Oh. You didn&#39;t have a good time?</p><p>Okay, you know what? Drop the act.</p><p>I know you gave them cookies.</p><p>Oh. Who cracked, anyway?</p><p>Porter.</p><p>So how was your, uh, dinner party?</p><p>Well, there was dinner, but it wasn&#39;t much of a party.</p><p>Uh-oh. What happened?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>Rex announced that he and Bree are in counseling.</p><p>She retaliated with this whole revelation</p><p>which I won&#39;t even go into now,</p><p>and the bottom line is he stormed out.</p><p>Clearly, there&#39;s trouble in paradise.</p><p>Honestly, I&#39;m not that surprised.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. I just never got the</p><p>idea that they were really happy.</p><p>Are we happy?</p><p>Man, oh, man.</p><p>I keep seeing that look on Rex&#39;s face,</p><p>and then him taking off like that.</p><p>Some night.</p><p>Then again, I would probably cry, too,</p><p>if I had to have sex with that woman.</p><p>I mean, you watch a man get torn down like that,</p><p>it makes you wonder why he let her get away with it.</p><p>Believe me, if a woman ever</p><p>humiliated me like that in public,</p><p>Hm-- it would only happen once.</p><p>So, uh, where are you going?</p><p>I&#39;ll be staying at the motor lodge.</p><p>The hotel by the Interstate has better rates,</p><p>and it&#39;s closer to your work.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>I&#39;m packing your swimsuit.</p><p>There&#39;s a pool there,</p><p>and I know how swimming relaxes you.</p><p>When our kids ask where I am, what are you going to say?</p><p>I could tell them that you went to tennis camp.</p><p>That was a joke.</p><p>Yeah. I got it.</p><p>Obviously, if you&#39;ve forgotten anything,</p><p>you can, um, come right back and get it.</p><p>Well, I&#39;ll call you.</p><p>Rex.</p><p>In college, when we first started dating,</p><p>people were so jealous of us.</p><p>We were the golden couple.</p><p>Everybody knew we were going to have this wonderful life.</p><p>Why is this happening?</p><p>Because you can&#39;t even let me pack my own suitcase.</p><p>All right, see ya. Have fun.</p><p>Where are you going?</p><p>Just a sec.</p><p>Mom?</p><p>Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not packing heat.</p><p>Hey, Brandy, would you scoot a little?</p><p>Just scoot. Thank you.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>I&#39;ll be quick.</p><p>Brandy, I&#39;m sorry for the way I treated you.</p><p>It was uncalled for and childish,</p><p>and it won&#39;t happen again.</p><p>I have built up a lot of anger towards you, both of you,</p><p>and I realize now that I just</p><p>can&#39;t carry that around anymore,</p><p>so apology or no apology,</p><p>I&#39;m moving on.</p><p>Mrs. Mayer?</p><p>Brandy.</p><p>Brandy, get in the car.</p><p>Mrs. Mayer.</p><p>Please, call me Susan.</p><p>I just wanted you to know</p><p>what happened between me and Karl,</p><p>things got out of hand.</p><p>Because I thought your marriage was over.</p><p>Anyway, I just wanted you to know</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I really am.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>And though it came from an unexpected source,</p><p>Susan finally got the apology she&#39;d always wanted.</p><p>Hey. Let me take those.</p><p>You&#39;re wearing a really big hat.</p><p>Yes, I am.</p><p>Listen, the kids are watching a video,</p><p>which means that we&#39;ve got only about 45</p><p>minutes until they actually find Nemo,</p><p>so I suggest that we make the most of it.</p><p>By reliving your night out with the guys?</p><p>Lynette...</p><p>I&#39;m trying.</p><p>You look... ridiculous in that thing.</p><p>Sexy ridiculous?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>I can live... with maybe.</p><p>You know, it&#39;s going to take more than just this one night.</p><p>I know.</p><p>Looks like we have an audience.</p><p>Let &#39;em look.</p><p>As long as they don&#39;t try and cut in.</p><p>Dr. Goldfine.</p><p>Bree. We&#39;re not scheduled now, are we?</p><p>I didn&#39;t have time to make an appointment.</p><p>Rex moved out today.</p><p>Oh, I&#39;m very sorry to hear that,</p><p>but unfortunately, I&#39;m completely booked right now.</p><p>I don&#39;t need much time.</p><p>It just seems that you have more insight into my situation</p><p>than I do, and I just think --</p><p>Bree, we can&#39;t talk now.</p><p>If you could just tell me what he told you,</p><p>then I could fix the problem.</p><p>I can&#39;t do that. It&#39;s completely unethical.</p><p>Well, why can&#39;t you --</p><p>That&#39;s my next appointment.</p><p>You really need to go.</p><p>Dr. Goldfine, please.</p><p>Hold on. I&#39;ll go and talk to my client.</p><p>Bree searched for Rex&#39;s audiotape</p><p>hoping to find answers.</p><p>She found answers, all right,</p><p>but to entirely different questions.</p><p>I understand completely.</p><p>I&#39;ll -- I&#39;ll be out in just a minute.</p><p>Bree, I&#39;m -- I&#39;m sorry. He can&#39;t wait,</p><p>but I can see you first thing</p><p>in the morning -- 8:00.</p><p>8:00.</p><p>Sorry to interupt.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>Yes, I remember the world --every detail.</p><p>And what I remember most is how afraid I was.</p><p>What a waste.</p><p>You see, to live in fear is not to live at all.</p><p>I wish I could tell this to those I left behind,</p><p>but would it do any good?</p><p>Probably not.</p><p>I understand now --</p><p>there will always be those who face their fears...</p><p>And there will always be those who run away.</p><h2 id="dh-se01-e04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dh-se01-e04" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DH SE01 E04</h2><p>Anybody home?</p><p>Susan played with fire... - That&#39;s not my cup.</p><p>And could get burned.</p><p>Go to a spa, go shopping.

Yes, this is me.</p><p>But, unfortunately for Lynette,</p><p>this new label frequently fell short of what was advertised.</p><p>How in the world did they...?</p><p>I left the door to the art supply</p><p>cupboard open for five minutes.</p><p>That&#39;s all. - Five minutes.</p><p>The little girl, why didn&#39;t she say anything?</p><p>Your boys work quickly.</p><p>Well, obviously they will be punished for this severely.</p><p>I hesitate bringing this up, since you</p><p>got so ugly about it last time...</p><p>They don&#39;t have attention deficit disorder,</p><p>and I won&#39;t drug my boys</p><p>just to make your job easier.</p><p>I&#39;d rather change teachers.</p><p>The boys are in my class because I&#39;m the</p><p>only teacher who can handle them.</p><p>What if we separate the twins,</p><p>put them in different classes?</p><p>They&#39;re much calmer when they&#39;re not bouncing off one another.</p><p>We can try that, but if it doesn&#39;t work,</p><p>we may no longer be able to accommodate them.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to Lynette,</p><p>her label was about to change yet again.</p><p>And for the next few years, she would be known as</p><p>the mother of the boys who painted Tiffany Axelrod blue.</p><p>It looked to be an interesting afternoon on Wisteria Lane.</p><p>A mysterious cassette tape had</p><p>been discovered by my friend Bree.</p><p>She had stolen it from her marriage counselor.</p><p>A counselor I&#39;d once spoken to in strictest confidence.</p><p>So how have you been?</p><p>I had the nightmare again.</p><p>It&#39;s weird to hear Mary Alice.</p><p>Still the same one? - Yes.</p><p>But this time I was standing in a river</p><p>and I saw the girl under the water.</p><p>She kept screaming &quot;Angela&quot; over and over again.</p><p>What do you think the significance of the name &quot;Angela&quot; is?</p><p>Actually, that&#39;s my real name.</p><p>Her real name?</p><p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen her driver&#39;s license. I did not say Angela.</p><p>Bree, what does it say in the rest of the tape?</p><p>Just more about her nightmares,</p><p>and this girl she was afraid of.</p><p>So what the hell do we do now?</p><p>I think we should show Paul the note.</p><p>Are you sure? He&#39;s gonna freak.</p><p>It&#39;s now or never.</p><p>I saw what he&#39;s asking for the place.</p><p>It&#39;s gonna sell quickly.</p><p>Can I say something?</p><p>I&#39;m glad Paul&#39;s moving. - Gaby.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. He&#39;s just always given my the creeps.</p><p>Haven&#39;t you guys noticed, he has this dark thing going on?</p><p>Something about him just feels...</p><p>Malignant? - Yes.</p><p>We&#39;ve all sort of felt it.</p><p>That being said, I do love what he&#39;s done with that lawn.</p><p>Mom, the dish is clean.</p><p>I still don&#39;t understand why you don&#39;t just</p><p>ask him out on an official date date.</p><p>I&#39;m trying a new strategy. I&#39;m playing hard to get.</p><p>How long do you think you can keep that up?</p><p>Maybe until noon.</p><p>Then I&#39;m going to have to run over there</p><p>and beg him to love me.</p><p>Uh, mom, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re</p><p>gonna be able to wait that long.</p><p>You got to be kidding.

Stop it! No. No.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna take the whole table. That&#39;s right.</p><p>Come on now. I mean it.</p><p>I love taking baths. Especially with you.</p><p>It&#39;s like taking a vacation from the world.</p><p>I hated taking baths when I was a kid.</p><p>Of course, back then,</p><p>the only thing I had to play with was my rubber ducky.</p><p>Who&#39;s that?</p><p>It&#39;s Mr. Solis.</p><p>Relax. Carlos is at work and he doesn&#39;t ring the doorbell.</p><p>It&#39;s the cable guy. He&#39;s three hours late.</p><p>Use the side entrance.</p><p>Gabrielle knew her vacation from the world had ended.</p><p>What she didn&#39;t know was John had left behind a souvenir.</p><p>I&#39;m telling dad didn&#39;t come home last night.</p><p>They had a fight. A bad one. - How bad?</p><p>Like divorce court bad.</p><p>Listen to her.</p><p>She always overcompensates when she&#39;s worried.</p><p>If dad moves out and leaves us with her,</p><p>I&#39;ll lose my mind.</p><p>Dinner is on the table.</p><p>Mom, where did dad go last night?</p><p>He got a last minute call to speak at</p><p>a medical conference in Philadelphia.</p><p>Take your seats.</p><p>This marriage is so over.</p><p>Andrew?</p><p>Again sorry I was late.</p><p>The scheduler overbooked me.</p><p>How long are you going to be? - Almost done.</p><p>What is that scent? Is that sage and citrus?</p><p>That&#39;s amazing.</p><p>Try to hurry. I have stuff to do.</p><p>Come on.</p><p>What&#39;s happening?</p><p>The cable guy fell.</p><p>He hit his head on the tub. He may have a concussion.</p><p>It&#39;s almost eight. - He was late.</p><p>Mrs. Huber.</p><p>Hello, Susan. I made you a pie.</p><p>Oh, wow! Why?</p><p>Do I need a motive to do something nice?</p><p>I can&#39;t wait for you to try this.</p><p>It&#39;s mincemeat.</p><p>Actually, I just had dinner.</p><p>That&#39;s ok. You can save it for later.</p><p>What&#39;s so funny?</p><p>I was just thinking of that expression,</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll make mincemeat out of you&quot;.</p><p>Mincemeat used to be an entrap of mostly chopped meat,</p><p>so it was like saying,</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll chop you up into little bits.&quot;</p><p>but that was centuries ago.</p><p>Today, mincemeat is mostly made of</p><p>fruit, spices and rum.</p><p>There&#39;s no meat in it and still people say,</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll make mincemeat out of you.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know that people really say that anymore.</p><p>I do.</p><p>So, Susan, how are you?</p><p>I&#39;m fine.</p><p>Good. You know, I have a confession to make.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wish I&#39;d been more supportive when Karl left you.</p><p>Oh, you don&#39;t have to apologize about Karl.</p><p>Really, Karl and I are over.</p><p>I&#39;ve moved on. - Yes, I know.</p><p>You&#39;ve moved on to that nice Mike Delfino.</p><p>He&#39;s quite a catch, isn&#39;t he?</p><p>You like him, don&#39;t you?</p><p>Ah, sure, as a friend.</p><p>Oh, Susan.</p><p>Being coy is a strategy best employed</p><p>by virgins at their first dance.</p><p>For women of our age,</p><p>it&#39;s just annoying.</p><p>You sure you don&#39;t want pie?</p><p>No, thank you.</p><p>I hope it works out with you and Mike.</p><p>You&#39;ve been so desperate to land him.</p><p>What? I am not desperate.</p><p>Good lord, Susan,</p><p>you burned your rival&#39;s house down.</p><p>If that isn&#39;t desperate,</p><p>I don&#39;t know what is.</p><p>Mrs. Huber, with all due respect, you&#39;re crazy.</p><p>What&#39;s that? - I think you recognize it.</p><p>I found it in the ruins of Eddie&#39;s home.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s not... - Shh. My point is this.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t there for you when Karl left,</p><p>but I am here for you now.</p><p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is our secret.</p><p>And no one ever need know.</p><p>Oh, Susan.</p><p>You don&#39;t know how good it feels</p><p>to finally be able to help you.</p><p>You look so pale.</p><p>Now, I insist you try some of my pie.</p><p>Go on.</p><p>Did I mention it&#39;s mincemeat?</p><p>Open the door, please. - Hang on.</p><p>What? - May I come in?</p><p>No. - I want to talk to you.</p><p>Then talk. - Where were you last night?</p><p>Brian&#39;s. - I just spoke to Brian&#39;s mother.</p><p>Tell me again where you were last night,</p><p>and this time don&#39;t lie to me.</p><p>Where did you say dad was again? In Philadelphia?</p><p>Andrew, don&#39;t change the subject.</p><p>Sorry, I thought the subject was telling lies.</p><p>I called dad&#39;s cell phone.</p><p>I know he moved out.</p><p>Well, it&#39;s just temporary and...</p><p>...I thought it would upset you so I was protecting you.</p><p>Whatever. You lied.</p><p>So stop pretending like you have</p><p>some sort of moral authority.</p><p>Andrew, just because I chose not to</p><p>share my marital problems with you</p><p>doesn&#39;t give you the right to be rude.</p><p>How about driving my father away.</p><p>Do I get to be rude then?</p><p>What&#39;s this?</p><p>It&#39;s a sock. - It&#39;s a man&#39;s sock.</p><p>I found it under our bed.</p><p>It&#39;s not mine.</p><p>Oh, for god sakes, Carlos, it&#39;s Yao Lin&#39;s.</p><p>Our maid wears size 13 gym socks?</p><p>No, she dusts with them.</p><p>See? Socks instead of rags.</p><p>Susan, hello. - Mrs. Huber.</p><p>Did you and Mike come together?</p><p>I saw him over in the fresh produce aisle.</p><p>No. Like I told you. We&#39;re just friends.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>By the way, if I didn&#39;t make it clear yesterday,</p><p>I absolutely did not do that thing you accuse me of.</p><p>Hey, Susan. Hey, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>Nice to see you, Mike.</p><p>Hey. You like Alfred Hitchcock?</p><p>They&#39;re doing a retrospective at the rialto.</p><p>Uh... ...I&#39;m not really a fan.</p><p>Come on, how can you not like Hitchcock?</p><p>I just, uh, don&#39;t.</p><p>Oh. Ok.</p><p>Well, uh, nice to see you.</p><p>You too, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>You&#39;re so silly.</p><p>Pretending not to like him on my account.</p><p>I mean, really.</p><p>Will you just drop it?</p><p>You shouldn&#39;t be rude to me.</p><p>Your secret is not an easy burden to bear.</p><p>That insurance company is putting Eddie through hell.</p><p>But still I&#39;ve said nothing. - Well...</p><p>The longer it takes for her payment,</p><p>the longer she&#39;ll be staying with me.</p><p>Eating me out of house and home. Using up my hot water.</p><p>What exactly is it you want from me, Mrs. Huber?</p><p>Are these together?</p><p>Ring it up.</p><p>If the school and the pediatrician</p><p>think the twins could be medicated,</p><p>then what&#39;s the problem?</p><p>I used to run a company with 85 people,</p><p>and now I can&#39;t wrangle three</p><p>small boys without doping them?</p><p>Talk about feeling like a failure.</p><p>Lynette, you are a great mother.</p><p>But, let&#39;s face it,</p><p>your kids are a challenge.</p><p>Thank you. That&#39;s the nicest way you could&#39;ve said that.</p><p>You know, the truth is</p><p>when they&#39;re not making me want to tear my hair out,</p><p>they&#39;re actually really sweet.</p><p>I&#39;m afraid if I change the bad stuff,</p><p>I&#39;m going to change the good stuff.</p><p>It&#39;s a tough call.</p><p>Like this mug.</p><p>I love this mug. If I medicate them,</p><p>will they still make me a mug like this?</p><p>You know, it&#39;s leaking.</p><p>Yeah, I know.</p><p>We talked to Paul. We told him</p><p>we need to show him something.</p><p>He&#39;s on his way over.</p><p>So, Paul, we notice that you&#39;re selling the house.</p><p>Yes, too many painful memories. I&#39;m sure you understand.</p><p>Before you move, we thought there&#39;s something you should know.</p><p>It seems there may be more to Mary Alice&#39;s</p><p>death than you are aware of.</p><p>Remember when you asked us to pack her things?</p><p>Well, when we did, we found a note.</p><p>And we think that you should have it.</p><p>You can see from the postmark,</p><p>Mary Alice probably got it the day she died.</p><p>Paul, are you going to be okay? - No.</p><p>Have you always cleaned with socks? - Yes.</p><p>What is that, a Japanese thing?</p><p>I am Chinese.</p><p>I don&#39;t like lying.</p><p>I don&#39;t like your ironing, so there.</p><p>Mrs. Solis, what are you doing here?</p><p>Carlos found this under the bed.</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>It&#39;s ok. It was close call,</p><p>but I managed to cover.</p><p>I got you these, so from now on,</p><p>we can&#39;t let Carlos see you wearing</p><p>anything resembling a gym sock.</p><p>You want me to mow your lawn in sandals.</p><p>I could lose a toe.</p><p>Imagine what you&#39;d lose if he finds out</p><p>you&#39;re trimming more than the hedge.</p><p>Why are your friends staring at me?</p><p>Did you tell them about us? - No.</p><p>They&#39;re staring &#39;cause they think you&#39;re hot.</p><p>Oh... Ok.</p><p>It&#39;s 9:30. What is your brother thinking?</p><p>Want my advice? Call dad.</p><p>Tell him to go kick Andrew&#39;s ass.</p><p>I am perfectly capable of handling this without your father.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. - Where&#39;s your cell phone?</p><p>Call Andrew. Find out where he is.</p><p>He&#39;ll know you&#39;re behind this.</p><p>He won&#39;t. Just act normal.</p><p>Hey, it&#39;s me. Ah, what&#39;s going on?</p><p>He knows.</p><p>Andrew, this is your mother.</p><p>I am rapidly reaching the end of my patience with you.</p><p>Where are you? Are you at a bar?</p><p>Andrew? Andrew?</p><p>Mom? - He hung up on me.</p><p>What are you gonna do?</p><p>Heath. Lan. Andrew.</p><p>Mom, how did you even know I was here?</p><p>You went in my room? - You think that&#39;s bad?</p><p>Tomorrow morning, I&#39;m cleaning it.</p><p>Oh, by the way, Heath.</p><p>I didn&#39;t get a chance to tell you,</p><p>that was a lovely solo last week at church.</p><p>Thank you. We&#39;re out of here.</p><p>I hope it wasn&#39;t something I said.</p><p>Well, Andrew, shall we?</p><p>You just humiliated me in front of my friends.</p><p>I&#39;m not going anywhere with you. - Fine.</p><p>What are you doing? - I&#39;m staying for the show.</p><p>I&#39;m dying to see what all the fuss is about.</p><p>Excuse me, waitress. I&#39;ll have a glass of your house Chardonnay.</p><p>Of course, ma&#39;am.</p><p>I&#39;m curious. Andrew,</p><p>as you fantasize about this woman,</p><p>do you ever stop and think how</p><p>she came to be on this runway?</p><p>That&#39;s someone&#39;s little girl.</p><p>And that someone probably had a lot of dreams for her.</p><p>Dreams that did not include a thong and a pole.</p><p>It&#39;s not going to work, ok? I&#39;m not budging.</p><p>God knows what she&#39;s had to deal with in life.</p><p>Abject poverty, drugs, domestic violence,</p><p>maybe even molestation.</p><p>Mom!</p><p>Now she treats herself the way</p><p>other men treat her. Like an object. A piece of meat.</p><p>That does it. Kid, get her out of here.</p><p>She&#39;s killing it for the rest of us.</p><p>We&#39;re not here, leave a message.</p><p>It&#39;s Mrs. Huber, Susan, are you there?</p><p>I can see your lights are on.</p><p>I hope you&#39;re not screening. That&#39;s so tacky.</p><p>Listen. I need to talk to you.</p><p>My water heater just burst</p><p>and it&#39;s gonna cost me $600 to get a new one.</p><p>And I can&#39;t afford that.</p><p>I&#39;m just beside myself. Call me as soon as you get in.</p><p>Julie, honey, wake up.</p><p>We need to talk.</p><p>Can&#39;t this wait until morning?</p><p>I think I&#39;m being blackmailed.</p><p>And when I realized I couldn&#39;t put out the fire, I ran.</p><p>I must&#39;ve dropped the measuring cup in the process.</p><p>Why do I even let you out of the house?</p><p>Obviously, I can&#39;t let her get away with this.</p><p>The only thing to do is go to the police</p><p>and tell them what happened.</p><p>You can&#39;t do that.</p><p>Julie, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll throw me in jail.</p><p>I mean, it was an accident.</p><p>Dad won&#39;t care if it was an accident.</p><p>You know he&#39;ll just use this as an excuse to reopen custody.</p><p>Mom, I don&#39;t want to live with dad. - I know.</p><p>I need to talk to you. - Cool. Sure.</p><p>You were working tuesday, right? - Yeah.</p><p>You remember the cable guy showing up?</p><p>And you usually work till what time, five?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Damn it. That means he was in the house for four hours.</p><p>Wait. Now that I think about it,</p><p>I might not have seen him.</p><p>Either you saw him or you didn&#39;t. Which is it?</p><p>I didn&#39;t.</p><p>John...</p><p>...did my wife ask you to lie for her?</p><p>Mr. Solis, uh... I really don&#39;t want</p><p>to get in the middle of anything.</p><p>Thank you. That&#39;s all I needed to know.</p><p>Let&#39;s run through it one more time.</p><p>Mom, it&#39;s not brain surgery.</p><p>You&#39;ll stand guard while I crawl through Mrs. Huber&#39;s doggie door.</p><p>Once inside, I find the measuring cup.</p><p>Simple.</p><p>Mm, god. I hate that I&#39;m turning you into a little thief.</p><p>It&#39;s our cup. We&#39;re just taking back what&#39;s ours.</p><p>That&#39;s right. Ethically,</p><p>we have nothing to be ashamed about.</p><p>Oh. Wear these. I don&#39;t want you to leave finger prints.</p><p>There she goes. Ok. Move.</p><p>Oh, so glad to be playing frisbee again.</p><p>Here you go. Coming at you</p><p>All right. Back up a little more. There you go.</p><p>Whoo! All right. Here we go.</p><p>Oh, my, whoops! You better go get that. Yeah. Hah!</p><p>Mike. - Hey, Susan.</p><p>I thought that was you.</p><p>Uh... Yeah. Julie and I are out tossing a frisbee around,</p><p>and it flew off into Mrs. Huber&#39;s back yard.</p><p>Oh, you need some help?</p><p>No, no, no. Julie&#39;s got it.</p><p>Ok. I&#39;m glad I ran into you.</p><p>I wanted to make sure things were ok between us.</p><p>The other day, you seemed kind of distant.</p><p>Distant? What do you mean?</p><p>I mean, you&#39;re not mad at me for some reason, are you?</p><p>No. No, not at all.</p><p>Good. &#39;cause I&#39;m gonna take one more shot.</p><p>I got tickets for a Billy Wilder retrospective,</p><p>Wednesday night.</p><p>I&#39;d love to take you with me.</p><p>You are so sweet. I&#39;d love to go.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Eddie, I thought you&#39;d be at work.</p><p>I&#39;m not feeling well.</p><p>I got a sunburn the other day washing my car.</p><p>Well, don&#39;t just run off. Come and hang out with us.</p><p>Boy, you are one sick ticket. - What?</p><p>It&#39;s not bad enough I have to watch</p><p>you throw yourself at him every day.</p><p>Now you want to make sure I see it up close and personal?</p><p>No, it&#39;s not like that. - I&#39;ve got to take off.</p><p>I&#39;ll call about Wednesday night, ok?</p><p>Edie, wait.</p><p>Mike and I were gonna go see the movies on Wednesday</p><p>and I thought it would be fun if you joined us.</p><p>You want me to come with you? - Yeah.</p><p>Yeah, that&#39;s ok, isn&#39;t it, Mike?</p><p>Well, it&#39;s a limited engagement.</p><p>And it&#39;s sold out. I&#39;ve only got two tickets.</p><p>Edie, wait. You should take my ticket.</p><p>Really? Is that ok with you, Mike?</p><p>Uh, yeah, sure.</p><p>So, uh, what time do you want to pick me up?</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>You think you can have sex with anyone you want, huh?</p><p>Carlos couldn&#39;t help but feel proud of himself.</p><p>After all, he&#39;d just defended his honor.</p><p>Or had he?</p><p>Are you gay? - Yes. Is that why you&#39;re doing this?</p><p>&quot;Will you buy some chocolates?&quot;</p><p>Ladies.</p><p>Hey, Paul, what&#39;s up?</p><p>I wanted to apologize for my outburst yesterday.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about it. We unloaded a lot on you.</p><p>I suppose you&#39;re wondering why I</p><p>reacted so violently to that note.</p><p>It did... cross our minds.</p><p>Well, the truth is, Mary Alice was not a well person.</p><p>She was very troubled.</p><p>Troubled? - At first it was harmless.</p><p>She&#39;d leave herself notes, reminders like,</p><p>&quot;pick up the milk&quot;</p><p>or &quot;Zach has a dentist appointment.&quot;</p><p>But over time the notes became ugly.</p><p>Hateful messages started showing up.</p><p>Mary Alice was writing them to me,</p><p>to Zach, to herself.</p><p>Really? - That&#39;s why I lost it.</p><p>I was reminded of what Zach and I had been through.</p><p>Paul, I&#39;m so sorry. - We had no idea.</p><p>No.</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;d appreciate it</p><p>if you kept this to yourselves.</p><p>For Zach&#39;s sake. - Of course. Of course.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>I think he&#39;s lying. - Huh. So do I.</p><p>You didn&#39;t get me! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Boys, could you get in here, please?</p><p>He broke my plane. - I did not.</p><p>We&#39;ll talk about that later. I need you to take medicine.</p><p>Are we sick?</p><p>Not exactly. There is a special medicine.</p><p>It&#39;s like a vitamin and you&#39;ll take it every day, ok?</p><p>Stay right there.</p><p>Now open up.</p><p>Here, you... - No.</p><p>Guys, this is a... guys, here... - Nope.</p><p>In that moment, Lynette made a decision.</p><p>When it came to dealing with her children,</p><p>medication was no longer an option.</p><p>Of course, given her continuing level of frustration,</p><p>Lynette also felt a little</p><p>self-medication couldn&#39;t hurt.</p><p>So what&#39;s your strategy?</p><p>Are you just never gonna speak to me again?</p><p>Something like that.</p><p>I suppose I do owe you an apology.</p><p>Careful. I wouldn&#39;t want you to strain yourself.</p><p>I shouldn&#39;t have lied to you about your father.</p><p>You two are old enough to handle the truth</p><p>and I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>Keep going.</p><p>I&#39;m mad at you for about 7,000 other things.</p><p>If you think I&#39;ll apologize for taking</p><p>you out of a strip club, you&#39;re wrong.</p><p>I consider it one of my finest moments.</p><p>Oh, Andrew.</p><p>I know you blame me</p><p>for what&#39;s happening with your father,</p><p>but it&#39;s not entirely my fault and</p><p>I need you to understand that.</p><p>I do.</p><p>I just... don&#39;t want him to leave.</p><p>Neither do I.</p><p>Mom. - Yeah?</p><p>When can I have my door back?</p><p>Three months.</p><p>Royal Oaks was the scene of a hate crime today.</p><p>Jonathan Lisco, local gay activist</p><p>and part-time female impersonator,</p><p>was brutally attacked in his home.</p><p>Lisco speculated the attack</p><p>was in response to his efforts</p><p>to secure same-sex partner insurance</p><p>coverage from his employer,</p><p>Cliffside cable.</p><p>Police are circulating this sketch of the assailant.</p><p>The circumstances speak for themselves.</p><p>I&#39;ve taken a strong stance with my company.</p><p>Is there something you want to ask me?</p><p>No.</p><p>You took it, didn&#39;t you?</p><p>Good evening, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>It&#39;s my own fault for not hiding the cup.</p><p>If you&#39;re capable of arson,</p><p>obviously you&#39;re capable of breaking and entering.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.

Nothing was taken.</p><p>Still, somebody broke in.

So?</p><p>Most women that shop a lot, it&#39;s because</p><p>they don&#39;t have anything better to do.</p><p>What&#39;s your point? - Well, if you had children...</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>I&#39;m just saying that children give your life a purpose.</p><p>You&#39;re so busy taking care of them</p><p>you don&#39;t have time to wonder if you&#39;re happy.</p><p>You know, Juanita, this is so like you.</p><p>I invite you on a nice shopping</p><p>trip and you find ways to upset me.</p><p>You didn&#39;t invite me. I invited myself.</p><p>You keep looking at your watch.</p><p>Is there some place you have to be?</p><p>No! And I am not one of those</p><p>women who has a hole in her heart</p><p>that can only be filled by a baby.</p><p>I like my life a lot. It&#39;s very fulfilling.</p><p>Excuse my daughter-in-law. She&#39;s very fulfilled.</p><p>So he just blew you off?</p><p>I told him another man asked me out.</p><p>It was a perfect opportunity for</p><p>Mike to be jealous, and nothing.</p><p>Did you bat your eyes? It doesn&#39;t work if you don&#39;t bat your eyes.</p><p>I batted everything that wasn&#39;t nailed down. Nothing.</p><p>Thanks. - So what&#39;s going on there?</p><p>Gophers.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry about Mike. I know you like him.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s my fault.</p><p>Maybe I just imagined an entire relationship</p><p>with this man that didn&#39;t exist.</p><p>There has been flirting. I have seen it.</p><p>And the flirting made me think he was kind,</p><p>trustworthy, honest and hygienic.</p><p>A guy just smiles at me three times</p><p>and I&#39;m picking out wedding china.</p><p>I&#39;m a mess.</p><p>But to be fair, that&#39;s part of your charm.</p><p>That&#39;s what happened with Karl.</p><p>I only dated him a couple of months.</p><p>I filled in the blankets, I married him.</p><p>It was a disaster.</p><p>You think Mike is a Karl in disguise?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. What does that mean anyway?</p><p>&quot;My life is complicated.&quot;</p><p>If I wanted to sit around and wait for nothing,</p><p>I could do it on the can.</p><p>You&#39;re late. What&#39;s with the face?</p><p>I screwed up. I broke into the</p><p>Frome house and almost got caught.</p><p>What&#39;s &quot;almost&quot;?</p><p>I accidentally left something behind with my prints on it.</p><p>Did you ever hear of gloves? - It&#39;s the suburbs.</p><p>I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d matter.</p><p>Anyway, the police are running</p><p>a check and I&#39;m in the system.</p><p>I gotta pull up stakes before they come looking for me.</p><p>That&#39;s a sweet sound. Laughter like that, huh?</p><p>Pisses me off.</p><p>If and when your cover is blown, you disappear.</p><p>Until then, you keep fixing the neighbors&#39; pipes.</p><p>The more time I spend at this town,</p><p>the more I think we&#39;re making a mistake.</p><p>These are nice people.</p><p>My money says one of them isn&#39;t.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>No more screw-ups.</p><p>I&#39;m getting something to drink. Do you want something?</p><p>Don&#39;t be mad. - I waited for three hours for you.</p><p>I had to use a month&#39;s worth of</p><p>lunch money to pay for that room.</p><p>It&#39;s not my fault.</p><p>Juanita hasn&#39;t let me out of her sight since she got here.</p><p>Really?

I said I was sorry.</p><p>Just so you know,</p><p>I&#39;ve turned down half the pep-squad for you.</p><p>You can&#39;t be serious.</p><p>I&#39;m starting to think that... maybe I</p><p>should be with someone my own age.</p><p>I thought teenage girls bored you, John.</p><p>I thought what we had was beyond that.</p><p>so did I.</p><p>Why go back to something you don&#39;t want?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. - Maybe you&#39;re tired of me.</p><p>No. I want to be with you.</p><p>Then why are we arguing?</p><p>Gabrielle! - Damn it!</p><p>The virgin gave it up already?</p><p>I want you so bad.</p><p>When can I see you again? - Tomorrow.</p><p>Meet me at the mall after school.</p><p>What about your mother-in-law? - I&#39;ll think of something.</p><p>Gabrielle! Gabrielle! - Coming!</p><p>A donation? Now Barcliff wants a donation?</p><p>Apparently we&#39;re in competition with one other family.</p><p>A generous donation will ensure our kids beat &#39;em out.</p><p>How generous? - 15 thousand.</p><p>We don&#39;t have that. - That&#39;s what I told them.</p><p>So what will we do? Public school is</p><p>out unless we move to a new district.</p><p>We&#39;re not moving.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s time that we look into home schooling.</p><p>I know you did not just say that.</p><p>Honey, it&#39;s got its advantages.</p><p>Kids at home school do better in their later years.</p><p>They won&#39;t make it to their later years</p><p>if I have to spend all day with them.</p><p>Honey, sometimes you&#39;ve just got to make the sacrifice.</p><p>It&#39;s probably the best thing for the kids.</p><p>Why don&#39;t we just put them back in me and cook</p><p>them until they&#39;re civilized.</p><p>You&#39;d be cool with that?</p><p>I&#39;ve never had plum pudding before.</p><p>I&#39;m serving it for christmas.</p><p>I like to try out new recipes before the actual holiday.</p><p>That way, if the cookbook&#39;s gotten it wrong, I can fix it.</p><p>You must really like Christmas.</p><p>You and Mr. Van de Kamp always have the best decorations.</p><p>I adore the holidays.</p><p>I never get depressed if there&#39;s a decorated tree.</p><p>My mom and I would always decorate our tree together.</p><p>This Christmas is gonna be weird. - Oh, Zach.</p><p>You know, my mother died when I</p><p>was young. She was hit by a car.</p><p>It was right before Christmas, as a matter of fact.</p><p>We were all singing carols and the dog was howling</p><p>because everybody in my family sings off-key except for me.</p><p>Anyway, it was a terrible ruckus.</p><p>So no one noticed when my mother went</p><p>out to give the neighbors a gift.</p><p>The next thing we heard were brakes screeching.</p><p>Most of my family went to the hospital</p><p>but I stayed home because I was so young.</p><p>When I looked out the window</p><p>I saw my mother&#39;s blood on the street</p><p>and nobody was doing anything about it.</p><p>So I got a hose and I washed it off.</p><p>And once it was clean, I felt so much better.</p><p>I&#39;ve never told anyone that story before.</p><p>Those are the most interesting ones.</p><p>The stories that we never tell anyone.</p><p>Yeah. You&#39;re probably right.</p><p>I have one.</p><p>It&#39;s more of a secret really.</p><p>I know why my mom killed herself.</p><p>You do? - It was something I did.</p><p>Something bad.</p><p>What did you do, Zach?</p><p>Zach. Sweetheart.</p><p>No. I shouldn&#39;t have said anything.</p><p>If my dad found out...</p><p>I won&#39;t tell your father!</p><p>I can&#39;t get you involved.</p><p>Zachary, it&#39;s all right!</p><p>I can&#39;t believe Zach said that.</p><p>What else did Zach tell you?</p><p>Just that Mary Alice killed herself</p><p>because of something he&#39;d done.</p><p>You couldn&#39;t get any more out of him?</p><p>Oh, I tried, but he was so nervous.</p><p>He actually started shaking then he just left.</p><p>Ok, this is getting really weird.</p><p>I think we should go to the police.</p><p>And tell them what?</p><p>We don&#39;t even have the note any more. We gave it to Paul.</p><p>You have to get Zach to tell you something</p><p>so we have more to go on.</p><p>Girls, You don&#39;t understand.</p><p>This poor kid is scared out of his mind.</p><p>Bree, for god&#39;s sakes, you&#39;re a woman.</p><p>Manipulate him. That&#39;s what we do.</p><p>But how?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. How did you usually manipulate Rex?</p><p>Hello, Zachary.</p><p>Are you free for dinner tonight?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Oh, good. Because last night you</p><p>put me in such a holiday mood.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna make roast turkey and candy yams and eggnog.</p><p>Have you ever had real, old-fashioned eggnog?</p><p>I don&#39;t think so. - You are gonna love it.</p><p>It has quite a kick.</p><p>Mine!</p><p>Preston! - Boys, could you stop...</p><p>Lynette was desperate to avoid home schooling.</p><p>But she saw no options on the horizon.</p><p>Until a solution sailed into view.</p><p>Gabrielle, please. You bought me enough things.</p><p>You&#39;re the one who&#39;s supposed to be shopping.</p><p>Mama, you&#39;re in a rut.</p><p>We need to spice up your wardrobe. Ooh. Here.</p><p>Try this one on. Go on. Try it on.</p><p>Mama Solis, how are you doing in there?</p><p>Is it supposed to be so tight?</p><p>Yes, it&#39;s form-fitting. You&#39;ll look great.</p><p>Gabrielle, I don&#39;t think this dress is right for me.</p><p>I can&#39;t breathe.</p><p>Well, maybe I made a mistake.</p><p>While you change,</p><p>I&#39;m gonna make a quick run to the book store.</p><p>Wait! I&#39;m coming with you!</p><p>No! I&#39;ll just be a minute!</p><p>I&#39;m coming with you!</p><p>Wait!</p><p>Gabrielle! Wait! - Ma&#39;am!</p><p>Ma&#39;am. Sorry, I&#39;m gonna need to look in your bags, please.</p><p>Fine. Just hurry up.</p><p>Right on time.</p><p>I don&#39;t know where that blouse came from.</p><p>Security. - Keep your stupid blouse.</p><p>I have to find my daughter-in-law.</p><p>Don&#39;t touch me. Don&#39;t you dare touch me!</p><p>Ma&#39;am, you have to come with us.</p><p>Get your hands off me! Gabrielle!</p><p>Hello.</p><p>Hey, it&#39;s me. - Oh, hi, Rex. How are you?</p><p>Is something wrong?</p><p>I was just about to grab dinner from that motel vending machine</p><p>and it occurred to me, &quot;what the heck? I&#39;ll go out.&quot;</p><p>Would you like to have dinner with me?</p><p>Mrs. Van de Kamp. Guess what.</p><p>I found all my mom&#39;s old Christmas stuff.</p><p>Oh. Sweetie, I was just coming over to talk to you.</p><p>I am so sorry but something important</p><p>came up and I have to cancel.</p><p>Really? - We&#39;ll do it again.</p><p>We&#39;ll have our impromptu holiday dinner. I promise.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>Mm. I got one. Kelly Halstatter.</p><p>In eighth grade, she used to spit in my gym shoes.</p><p>Kelly Halstatter.</p><p>Kelly Halstatter. Here, look.</p><p>Two duis, one check-kiting and an open bench warrant.</p><p>How tragic. By which I mean, &quot;yay&quot;.</p><p>You&#39;ve been a good sport coming on my shift with me.</p><p>Well, time flies when you&#39;re on a stakeout in cracktown.</p><p>So when does our official date begin?</p><p>Taxpayers say 20 minutes. But I say now.</p><p>They&#39;re down. - Thank you.</p><p>Honey, you read up on home schooling?</p><p>Yeah. It gave me some good ideas.</p><p>Well, one, anyway.</p><p>Great. What have you got?</p><p>You know how we both agree that one of us</p><p>needs to stay home and parent the kids</p><p>and one of us needs to make a living?</p><p>And then I suddenly remembered that when I was working</p><p>I made a little more than you.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>You tossed out that little sacrifice comment a while ago.</p><p>It occurred to me, I&#39;ve made</p><p>sacrifices over the past six years.</p><p>I gave up my career.</p><p>If another sacrifice has to be made,</p><p>I think it&#39;s your turn on the man go round.</p><p>Lynette? - So if I went back to work,</p><p>you could stay home and take care of the kids.</p><p>I can&#39;t be with the kids all day. I&#39;d lose my mind.</p><p>Hey. Ok, I get it. Home schooling is out.</p><p>How are we gonna scrape together</p><p>15 grand for this endowment?</p><p>Mm. How, how, how...</p><p>Think. Think real hard.</p><p>Oh, no. - Aye-aye.</p><p>The restaurant&#39;s run by this little old guy named Arinello.</p><p>He will propose to you. Don&#39;t say yes</p><p>because he&#39;s dead serious.</p><p>But what if I like him?</p><p>Hey. I thought this went to the lab.</p><p>All right. You got me.</p><p>And that means what? - Look, Susan.</p><p>No one would authorize lab time or a</p><p>computer search for a case like this.</p><p>It&#39;s just not a priority. - So why</p><p>couldn&#39;t you just tell me that?</p><p>Well, I thought we were clicking.</p><p>Does this need to be a big deal?</p><p>Well, if you&#39;d only lied to me about it once it wouldn&#39;t be.</p><p>All right. I get it. You want me to beg. Ok.</p><p>Look at me. I&#39;m begging.</p><p>Come on. Don&#39;t be such a girl about this.</p><p>I know who you are. You&#39;re a Karl in disguise.</p><p>I&#39;m done with you. All of you.</p><p>Oh, come on, drama queen. What are you doing?</p><p>Where are you going? It&#39;s not safe.</p><p>I&#39;d rather take my chances on the street,</p><p>thank you very much.</p><p>Why do I always pick the psychos?</p><p>Excuse me. I&#39;m a little lost.</p><p>You best be lost. This here&#39;s my corner.</p><p>Oh, yes. And a lovely corner it is.</p><p>And I hate to bother you while you&#39;re working.</p><p>I was just wondering if you</p><p>point me in the direction of a payphone?</p><p>Oh, if you have some change for</p><p>this five. Preferably quarters.</p><p>Honey, if I got paid in quarters,</p><p>I&#39;d be doing something very wrong.</p><p>Right. Ok.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Hey. You want to use my cell? I have weekend minutes.</p><p>Thank you so much. You&#39;re saving my life.</p><p>Excuse me, honey. - Oh, yes. You do what you&#39;ve got to do.</p><p>Oh, please answer. Come on. Pick up, Julie.</p><p>Oh, thank god. Don&#39;t ask any questions.</p><p>Just get somebody down here to pick me</p><p>up at the corner of Ninth and Foster.</p><p>Hey, babe.</p><p>Thank you. No. I&#39;m on a break.</p><p>Hurry, please.</p><p>Excuse me. We got a call. Something about a break-in.</p><p>One of your neighbors was reporting seeing someone</p><p>forcing his way into your home.</p><p>We sent some guys out to investigate and uh...</p><p>What is it? - I gotta tell you, ma&#39;am.</p><p>I thought I&#39;d seen a lot on the job,</p><p>but this is something else.</p><p>So let me get this straight.</p><p>He chopped down one of our pine trees?</p><p>I&#39;m afraid so.</p><p>Zach, why did you do this?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. - Take off those handcuffs, please.</p><p>Ma&#39;am, he confessed to breaking in.</p><p>This is not up for discussion.</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>Sir, you can&#39;t...</p><p>Zach.</p><p>Are you ok? - Yeah.</p><p>Then how much for a trip around the world?</p><p>I can&#39;t believe Julie sent you. She is soon gonna be dead.</p><p>Come on. Get in.</p><p>Wasn&#39;t that sent in for prints?</p><p>No. The cop lied to me.</p><p>I don&#39;t wanna talk about it. - Just asking.</p><p>Yes. Apparently they found a blouse in her bag.</p><p>I don&#39;t know, Carlos. At some point</p><p>older people start to get confused.</p><p>She probably thought she paid for it.</p><p>No, no charges. Everything&#39;s fine.</p><p>Ok. I&#39;ll tell her. Bye.</p><p>Carlos is gonna be late for dinner. It&#39;s just the two of us.</p><p>What would you like to eat? - I&#39;m not hungry.</p><p>Ok. Suit yourself.</p><p>Don&#39;t go yet. I need to talk to you.</p><p>It&#39;s important. Please.</p><p>I married Diego Solis when I was 16 years old.</p><p>A few months into our marriage, he started to beat me.</p><p>I was so young as to but I didn&#39;t know what to do.</p><p>Juanita, I had no idea.</p><p>It got so bad that I started praying to god to let me die.</p><p>But god, in his infinite wisdom, gave me a reason to live.</p><p>Carlos.</p><p>Ah, he was a beautiful baby.</p><p>But my husband wasn&#39;t much of a father.</p><p>He never held him. He would yell and</p><p>scream at him for no reason at all.</p><p>One night, when Carlos was four,</p><p>Diego Solis came home drunk.</p><p>And he beat my Carlos.</p><p>Something inside me snapped.</p><p>At that moment, I found a way to be strong.</p><p>So I made sure that Diego Solis</p><p>never hurt my son or me ever again.</p><p>What did you do?</p><p>Well, if you pray hard enough,</p><p>God gives you the tools to your salvation.</p><p>Carlos said that his father left for a waitress in El Paso.</p><p>Mm-hm. That&#39;s what he was told.</p><p>All mothers know they have to protect their children.</p><p>But some of us take our job more seriously than others.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re telling me this.</p><p>I think you do.</p><p>Ok. I know you&#39;re mad at me.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t stop you from going out with that guy.</p><p>I&#39;m not mad at you. I mean I&#39;m not just mad at you.</p><p>I&#39;m mostly mad at myself.</p><p>Ok. - I&#39;m mad that I like you so much</p><p>without knowing anything about you.</p><p>Oh. What do you want to know?</p><p>What&#39;s your favorite food? - Mexican.</p><p>What&#39;s your favorite sport? - Football.</p><p>Favorite band? - Elvis Costello.</p><p>That&#39;s a guy, not a band.</p><p>It&#39;s a guy with a band.</p><p>What do you think of me?</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, could you repeat that?</p><p>I don&#39;t want to talk about it. - This is insane!</p><p>Do you even care about me? - Do not talk that way!</p><p>Mrs. Van de Kamp. - Hi, Zach.</p><p>I wanted to see if everything was all right.</p><p>Everything&#39;s fine. - Are you sure?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Well, ok. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow then.</p><p>I&#39;m sure that you will.</p><p>People by their very nature are always</p><p>on the lookout for intruders...</p><p>Trying to prevent those on the outside from getting in.</p><p>But there will always be those who</p><p>force their way into our lives,</p><p>just as there will be those we invite in.</p><p>But the most troubling of all</p><p>will be the ones who stand on the outside looking in.</p><p>The ones we never truly get to know.</p><h2 id="dh-se01-e06" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dh-se01-e06" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DH SE01 E06</h2><p>I know why my mom killed herself.</p><p>Secrets were revealed.</p><p>This is being really weird. I think we should go to the police.</p><p>Relationships got complicated.</p><p>Mama Solis. What are you doing here?</p><p>You think she&#39;s cheating on you? - I think so.</p><p>I will take care of it</p><p>We got a call, something about a break-in.</p><p>I thought I&#39;ve seen a lot on the job</p><p>but this is something else.</p><p>And the mystery... - Zach, why did you do this?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. - Depened.</p><p>Zach.</p><p>Suburbia is a battle ground,</p><p>an arena for all forms of domestic combat.</p><p>Husbands clash with wives,</p><p>parents cross swords with children.</p><p>But the bloodiest battles often involve women</p><p>and their mothers-in-law.</p><p>The war for control of Carlos began the night he proposed,</p><p>and Gabrielle had been losing ground to Juanita ever since.</p><p>From the prenuptial agrement which she reluctantly signed...</p><p>to the selection of wedding music she despised...</p><p>to the color of the house paint she hadn&#39;t wanted,</p><p>Gabrielle had suffered one defeat after another.</p><p>And now that Juanita suspected her</p><p>daughter-in-law of having an affair,</p><p>it had become increasingly apparent, in this war</p><p>Mrs. Solis, I&#39;ll be at the market.</p><p>No prisoners would be taken.</p><p>Thank you, Yao Lin.</p><p>I don&#39;t see why you have her.</p><p>It&#39;s a big house. I need help.</p><p>It&#39;s only called help</p><p>when you do some of the work yourself.</p><p>I supervise.</p><p>You pay her $300 a week.</p><p>That&#39;s $15,000 a year.</p><p>Carlos, you always say you&#39;re not</p><p>putting away enough for retirement.</p><p>Baby, it would be a good idea to cut back on expenses.</p><p>You want me to take care of this place alone?</p><p>Other women manage.</p><p>That&#39;s nice.</p><p>You like that? - Oh, yeah.</p><p>God, I&#39;m gonna miss this, Carlos.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>Well, since I&#39;m gonna have to be doing the cooking</p><p>and the cleaning and all the shopping like the other wives,</p><p>I&#39;m gonna be exhausted at night,</p><p>just like all the other wives.</p><p>Till I build up my stamina, of course.</p><p>And that might take a couple of years.</p><p>Sadly for Juanita,</p><p>she had ignored the first rule of war...</p><p>Good morning, Carlos. - The maid stays.</p><p>Never underestimate your enemy.</p><p>Of the many suburban rituals,</p><p>none is quite so cherished as the neighborhood yard sale.</p><p>The shoppers come to sift through</p><p>the discarded belongings of someone they don&#39;t really know,</p><p>in hopes of finding bargains they don&#39;t really need,</p><p>each so determined to save a few pennies</p><p>They often miss hidden treasures.</p><p>Hey, Paul. - Hi, Susan.</p><p>I was a little surprised to see Mary Alice&#39;s award for sale.</p><p>She got it for doing charity work from the Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Zach and I are moving.</p><p>We don&#39;t need to carry any more than is necessary.</p><p>That makes sense.</p><p>I just wanted to make sure you didn&#39;t want it for Zach.</p><p>Something to remember his mother by.</p><p>Zach doesn&#39;t need a piece of glass to remember his mother.</p><p>I&#39;m out of newspaper. Here.</p><p>Let&#39;s call it ten bucks for everything.</p><p>Great. Speaking of Zach... I haven&#39;t seen him around lately.</p><p>He&#39;s been a bit depressed.</p><p>I thought he could use a change of scenery,</p><p>so I sent him to stay with relatives.</p><p>Oh. Which ones? - You don&#39;t know them.</p><p>How did you get the fat lip? - The usual way</p><p>asking too many questions.</p><p>Did you find out where Zach is? - No.</p><p>But I can tell this much you he&#39;s not staying with relatives.</p><p>She&#39;s driven me crazy, mama.</p><p>It could be any one of these guys she&#39;s having an affair with.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m not letting her out of my sight.</p><p>Who the hell is that?</p><p>Look the way she is touching him.</p><p>Do you think that&#39;s the guy she&#39;s having an affair with?</p><p>Carlos, don&#39;t be stupid with that.</p><p>A guy she talks to in public</p><p>isn&#39;t someone you&#39;re gonna worry about.</p><p>So it&#39;s someone that she doesn&#39;t talk to.</p><p>What I have to do, beat up every guy in town?</p><p>Marriage takes work.</p><p>I&#39;m not surprise that he&#39;s playing it close to the vest.</p><p>Paul knows we&#39;re onto him.</p><p>Zach said Mary Alice killed herself</p><p>because of something he&#39;d done. Something bad.</p><p>Is there anyone else who&#39;d know what he was talking about?</p><p>No. That&#39;s why we have to find him.</p><p>It&#39;s the only way we&#39;ll know the truth.</p><p>It just doesn&#39;t make any sense. Zach is such a sweet kid.</p><p>I can&#39;t imagine him doing anything that terrible.</p><p>He did break into your house.</p><p>I mean the kid&#39;s obviously troubled in some way.</p><p>Severe depression, borderline personality disorder.</p><p>Zach is a deeply troubled young man. - I&#39;m aware of that.</p><p>What are you giving him?</p><p>Antidepressants and a mood stabilizer.</p><p>Good.</p><p>I&#39;m also recommending extensive psychotherapy</p><p>to help unearth any repressed memory.</p><p>I don&#39;t think so.</p><p>Mr. Young, I can&#39;t just medicate him indefinitely.</p><p>Forget the Freud and stick with the drugs.</p><p>No new treatments without my permission.</p><p>Great version of little red riding hood.</p><p>It is your involvement</p><p>that makes the plays here at Barcliff Academy so special.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>I would like to turn over the next part of our meeting</p><p>to our parent coordinator, the amazing Maisy Gibbons.</p><p>Thank you, Miss Truesdale. Now before everyone leaves,</p><p>we have new copies of the script up here.</p><p>Tilda and Frances and I went to the rehearsal yesterday,</p><p>and we were a little troubled by the ending.</p><p>Killing the wolf. It sends the wrong message to our kids.</p><p>We believe that animals should only</p><p>be euthanized as a last resort.</p><p>Do you find something amusing?</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I thought you were kidding.</p><p>No. - Oh. Ok.</p><p>In our version, the wolf is aggressive</p><p>because he has a thorn in his paw,</p><p>and the woodsman will take out the</p><p>thorn and send Mr. Wolf on his way.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. Aren&#39;t we doing little red riding hood?</p><p>Yes. - So then you are aware that the wolf is a bad guy.</p><p>He eats little red&#39;s grandma.</p><p>If you let him go, he&#39;s gonna chow</p><p>down on other defenseless old ladies.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. And you are?</p><p>I&#39;m Lynette Scavo.</p><p>My twins just joined. They&#39;re playing oak trees.</p><p>Oh, of course. Lynette.</p><p>Let&#39;s see. You are signed up to</p><p>take tickets the night of the show, is that right?</p><p>Yeah. - Well, with all due respect,</p><p>let&#39;s leave the creative suggestions</p><p>to the mothers who have assumed the heavy lifting. Shall we?</p><p>Sure. Whatever.</p><p>I must say I&#39;m jealous of how</p><p>much time you two spend together.</p><p>My mother-in-law would never want</p><p>to hang out with me all day.</p><p>She sounds nice.</p><p>Hey there, you two.</p><p>Hi, John.</p><p>Mrs. Solis.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t aware you two were friends.</p><p>We go to the same school. - Of course you do.</p><p>Mama, if you need anything.</p><p>We&#39;ll be upstairs in my room studying.</p><p>Have fun.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t it make you nervous?</p><p>A boy alone upstairs with Danielle?</p><p>Oh, no. I don&#39;t worry about John.</p><p>Both he and Danielle are in the abstinence club.</p><p>Coffee&#39;s a little hot.</p><p>Susan was infuriated by Paul&#39;s evasive answers.</p><p>She was convinced he was deliberately hiding Zach</p><p>and hiding the truth.</p><p>She hoped that finding one would lead to the other.</p><p>To succeed, Susan would have to be evasive herself.</p><p>Susan. Long time no see. - Mrs. Greenberg.</p><p>Do you remember those two eggs</p><p>I let you borrow last Christmas?</p><p>I need those back. - Gosh, honey, I&#39;m fresh out.</p><p>But if you want, I could run to the store.</p><p>Oh, forget about it. It&#39;s not that important.</p><p>But since I&#39;m here, do you still have</p><p>that old hatchback sitting in your garage?</p><p>Can I borrow it tomorrow? - You want to borrow my car?</p><p>Just for a couple of hours.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure. Do you know how to drive a stick?</p><p>Yes, I think so. I learned in college.</p><p>It&#39;s like riding a bike, right?</p><p>I&#39;m not sure, dear.</p><p>It&#39;s no big deal. It&#39;s just for a couple of hours.</p><p>I let you borrow my eggs for a whole year.</p><p>Fist off, I&#39;m very pleased with the work we&#39;ve</p><p>done in our sessions thus far.</p><p>We&#39;re making excellent progress.</p><p>Thank you. I feel good about it.</p><p>But there are a few areas of your</p><p>marriage we haven&#39;t covered yet.</p><p>Oh, really? Like what?</p><p>I&#39;ve told Dr. Goldfine in our private sessions</p><p>that I&#39;m not happy with our sex life.</p><p>And Rex feels that when the two of you have intercourse,</p><p>you&#39;re not as connected as you could be.</p><p>Connected? - Yeah.</p><p>Like you&#39;re thinking about other things.</p><p>Is your hair getting messed up?</p><p>Did you buy the toothpaste? You&#39;re just not there.</p><p>This kind of disconnect is often</p><p>a symptom of a deeper problem.</p><p>So we were talking and the idea</p><p>of a sexual surrogate came up.</p><p>This is a licensed professional</p><p>who&#39;d work with you as a couple</p><p>on solving whatever sexual problems you may be having.</p><p>I have an excellent referral.</p><p>And what would this sexual surrogate person do?</p><p>She would coach us. - She?</p><p>She&#39;s very discreet. You&#39;ll hardly notice she&#39;s there.</p><p>Oh. So she would be in the room with us</p><p>while we make love?</p><p>Yes. Helping us to achieve maximum sexual potential.</p><p>Do you have any questions? - Just one.</p><p>How much longer is your mid-life crisis going to last?</p><p>Because it is really starting to tick me off.</p><p>Right. Everyone&#39;s down for a nap.</p><p>We&#39;ve got no more than an hour. Let&#39;s get cracking.</p><p>Five-card draw. Nothing wild.</p><p>How is it going with mike, Susan?</p><p>It&#39;s going, finally.</p><p>We have a first official date next week.</p><p>I think he&#39;s taking me to see a play or something.</p><p>Might I suggest the Barcliff Academy</p><p>production of little red riding hood?</p><p>Oh, that&#39;s right. The twins&#39; stage debut.</p><p>Are they having fun?</p><p>Sure. They play oak trees.</p><p>I have to deal with the drama behind the scenes.</p><p>Oh, I take it you&#39;ve met Maisy Gibbons?</p><p>She&#39;s a total nightmare.</p><p>I guess I shouldn&#39;t have challenged her. - Oh, dear.</p><p>Because now no one on the play committee wants to talk to me.</p><p>Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.</p><p>Hasn&#39;t changed since girl scouts.</p><p>Girls smile at you to your face</p><p>and then behind your back, make fun of you &#39;cause</p><p>you&#39;re the only one not shaving your legs yet.</p><p>That wouldn&#39;t happen in boy scouts.</p><p>When I worked with men,</p><p>I preferred the way they fought.</p><p>A guy takes his opponent on face-to-face,</p><p>and once he&#39;s won, he&#39;s top dog.</p><p>It&#39;s primitive but it&#39;s fair.</p><p>And a lot less sneaky.</p><p>Isn&#39;t it sexist of us to generalize like this?</p><p>It&#39;s science, Gabrielle.</p><p>Sociologists have documented this stuff.</p><p>Well, who am I to argue with sociologists?</p><p>Wow, this guacamole has got a kick.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna run to the little girl&#39;s room.</p><p>You go ahead. I might be a while.</p><p>I hate playing three-handed poker. Let&#39;s take a break.</p><p>I&#39;ll play. - You play poker?</p><p>I used to play with my grandfather. - Pull up a chair.</p><p>You&#39;re just playing for chips?</p><p>My grandfather used to say</p><p>it&#39;s always more fun to play for money.</p><p>Why not? 50 cents a bet? - Make it a buck.</p><p>Three raise limit, $20 buy-in.</p><p>Mrs. Solis! What are you doing?</p><p>Why haven&#39;t you returned my calls?</p><p>I&#39;ve been busy. - I&#39;ve seen who you&#39;ve been busy with.</p><p>Danielle? Come on. She&#39;s just a friend.</p><p>Before you get any friendlier, let me remind you,</p><p>I can do things to you she can&#39;t even pronounce.</p><p>A lot of good it does me with your</p><p>mother-in-law following you around all the time.</p><p>Maybe we should just cool it for a while.</p><p>No, John, please don&#39;t say that.</p><p>I have everything under control.</p><p>Now give me a boost.</p><p>Hey. So what did I miss?</p><p>Not much. Just a few friendly hands of poker with the girls.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late.</p><p>As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all heard,</p><p>Celia Bond broke her wrist playing tennis.</p><p>Which means we are now in desperate need</p><p>of someone to do the costumes.</p><p>I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed. Are there any volunteers?</p><p>I&#39;ll do it.</p><p>Really? That&#39;s a --Do you know how to sew?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Well, great. Thank you, Lynette.</p><p>Ok. So now that I&#39;m going to do some &quot;heavy lifting&quot;,</p><p>I believe I have the right to talk</p><p>about the changes made to the script?</p><p>Ladies.</p><p>We grew up with little red riding hood,</p><p>and survived it, scary stuff and all.</p><p>So I say to hell with political correctness.</p><p>Let our kids experience this classic</p><p>like it was meant to be enjoyed.</p><p>Let&#39;s kill the damn wolf and just</p><p>put on the best show we can.</p><p>Thank you, Lynette, for that impassioned speech.</p><p>But I believe that ship has sailed. - No! It hasn&#39;t.</p><p>We still have time to change the ending back.</p><p>And you know, Maisy, it is just a fairy tale.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it will upset the children.</p><p>I think you&#39;re wrong.</p><p>That&#39;s what&#39;s so great about democracy.</p><p>Everyone&#39;s entitled to their opinion.</p><p>Also, everyone has a right to vote.</p><p>So all in favor of the woodsman going</p><p>medieval on the big bad wolf&#39;s ass.</p><p>Dr. Goldfine.</p><p>Bree. - You&#39;re dining alone?</p><p>Actually, I am. - What a coincidence. So am I.</p><p>Seems a shame for us to eat by ourselves.</p><p>Shall I pull up a chair?</p><p>Bree, it&#39;s nothing personal,</p><p>but I never socialize with clients.</p><p>Oh, I get it. I&#39;m so sorry. Of course. It&#39;s inappropriate.</p><p>It&#39;s just that after what happened yesterday</p><p>there&#39;s so much I need to say because...</p><p>I suppose it can wait.</p><p>No, Lynette, I&#39;m sorry. Juanita&#39;s taking a bath.</p><p>How much did she win from you?</p><p>Jeez!</p><p>Yeah, I guess she&#39;ll take a check.</p><p>Ok. All right. Bye.</p><p>What was that about?</p><p>Turns out your mother is quite the card shark.</p><p>You let her play cards? How long did she play?</p><p>Not that long. Why?</p><p>Carlos, what is it?</p><p>I never told you this, but my mother</p><p>had a serious gambling problem.</p><p>Was this before we were married?</p><p>Yeah. It was bad.</p><p>She went into debt. Dipped into her savings,</p><p>started hocking jewelry.</p><p>Honey, it was only a small neighborhood game.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t take much for her to fall off the wagon.</p><p>I know she seems like a very strong woman but...</p><p>She has a major weakness.</p><p>Honey... Oh... It&#39;s ok.</p><p>You were right to tell me this.</p><p>And you understand I have to treat this as a session.</p><p>Of course. That&#39;s fine.</p><p>Shall I include the meal?</p><p>Oh, no. We&#39;ll split that.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>So let&#39;s talk about yesterday.</p><p>Do you think there might have</p><p>been some truth in what Rex said?</p><p>No, I don&#39;t.</p><p>Bree, you know. It&#39;s not uncommon for people experiencing</p><p>sexual repression to distance themselves during the act.</p><p>Is that how you see me?</p><p>As some sort of prude who just lays there like a cold fish?</p><p>I love sex. - All right.</p><p>I love everything about it. The sensations. The smells.</p><p>I especially love the feel of a man.</p><p>All that muscle and sinew pressed against my body.</p><p>And then when you add friction!</p><p>The tactile sensation of running my tongue</p><p>over a man&#39;s nipple ever so gently.</p><p>And then there&#39;s the act itself. Two bodies becoming one,</p><p>and that final eruption of pleasure.</p><p>To be honest. The only thing I don&#39;t like about sex is the scrotum.</p><p>Obviously it has its practical applications,</p><p>but I&#39;m not a fan.</p><p>Can I get you something?</p><p>Uh... Just the check, please.</p><p>Sir, you haven&#39;t ordered yet.</p><p>We&#39;re not shopping?</p><p>Oh, I thought we stop you for lunch first.</p><p>This place has the best buffet in town.</p><p>All-you-can-eat crab legs.</p><p>Oh, no! - What&#39;s wrong? Let&#39;s go.</p><p>Oh, I didn&#39;t realize how late it was.</p><p>They are only holding the suit minute for me until two.</p><p>If we stay I&#39;ll never make it.</p><p>We&#39;ll just have lunch at the mall.</p><p>Wait. Uh... I&#39;m really in the mood for crab legs.</p><p>Why don&#39;t you just drop me off and you can come back.</p><p>Well, if the mall is crowded it might take over an hour.</p><p>It&#39;s a buffet. There&#39;s no rush.</p><p>Hi, John. Motel. Ten minutes. Be there.</p><p>All right. Off you go. Thanks.</p><p>Lynette, I couldn&#39;t help notice</p><p>you forgot the coonskin on that hunter&#39;s coonskin cap.</p><p>Yeah. That was a creative call.</p><p>Look, I&#39;m in the middle of a costumes crisis.</p><p>If I don&#39;t take shortcuts I&#39;ll never finish.</p><p>Jordana Geist manages to get her work done.</p><p>She runs the concessions, paints the sets,</p><p>and still has time to take care of her three kids and a husband.</p><p>Now, we can&#39;t have the students suffer</p><p>just because you don&#39;t understand</p><p>the concept of time management.</p><p>I hardly think the kids are gonna suffer</p><p>without a clump of fur on their heads.</p><p>Ok. I&#39;ll make a creative call. We&#39;ll cut the oak trees.</p><p>That forest is looking a little dense anyway.</p><p>My boys are the oak trees. - Are they?</p><p>Well, I wouldn&#39;t worry.</p><p>We&#39;ll find something for them to do backstage.</p><p>That&#39;s where the real action is.</p><p>I&#39;ll finish the costumes. - Well. Crisis averted.</p><p>You have lost your mind. - I checked up on Silvercrest place.</p><p>It&#39;s a treatment center for troubled kids.</p><p>Who is gonna notice. One more,</p><p>I create the distraction, you blend in and find Zach.</p><p>How could I blend in with messed-up teenagers?</p><p>I don&#39;t know, Julie.</p><p>You pretend to be bulimic. Gag a little.</p><p>Come on. Work with me here.</p><p>Mama, when this is over,</p><p>we need to talk about your parenting skills.</p><p>Ok, fine. You don&#39;t want to help me,</p><p>I&#39;m not gonna force you.</p><p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to. It&#39;s just...</p><p>Why does this mean so much to you?</p><p>Because Mary Alice was a wonderful person.</p><p>And now all anybody thinks about her is that</p><p>she went off the deep end and did this terrible, selfish thing.</p><p>And I think there&#39;s more to it than that.</p><p>she was my friend, Julie,</p><p>and I owe it to her to find out the truth.</p><p>Juanita, what&#39;s wrong?</p><p>Juanita?</p><p>I didn&#39;t go to the buffet. I went gambling instead and I lost.</p><p>How much did you have on you? It couldn&#39;t have been much.</p><p>I used Carlos&#39; credit card.</p><p>Ok. How much did you charge?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. It stopped working.</p><p>What do you mean it stopped working?</p><p>This thing has like a $15,000 credit limit.</p><p>The man at the desk said there were no vacant rooms.</p><p>Mind if I bunk with you?</p><p>Bree, what are you doing here?</p><p>It&#39;s a little chilly out here.</p><p>Do you mind if we discuss this inside?</p><p>Come on in.</p><p>Sure is nice and toasty in here.</p><p>You look amazing. - Thanks.</p><p>I was hoping you&#39;d notice.</p><p>Well, it certainly isn&#39;t the Ritz,</p><p>but it has all the essentials.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what to say.</p><p>The perhaps you should say nothing.</p><p>Rex? Baby...</p><p>I just need a minute. - What?</p><p>Sweetie, just leave it, will you? Just leave it.</p><p>Ok, baby. Where were we?</p><p>I told you to leave it.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I just...</p><p>Oh, come on. Are you gonna make a big deal about this?</p><p>You know? To tell you the truth.</p><p>Now is not really a good time for me.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious you&#39;ve never had to remove a cheese stain.</p><p>Bree, I totally understand. Yeah, I already tried Susan.</p><p>And Gaby can&#39;t sew. Seriously, I&#39;m gonna be fine.</p><p>Yeah. Ow! Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m a little ahead with my painting.</p><p>If you need some help.</p><p>Oh, Jordana, you are a life-saver. Thank you.</p><p>Here. These pieces need trim.</p><p>I&#39;ll help for as long as I can,</p><p>but I have a lot on my plate tonight.</p><p>I have to make 25 mini Quiches for my book club.</p><p>You&#39;re not a human, are you?</p><p>You were sent by aliens to make humans race feel inadequate.</p><p>Seriously, how do you cram it all in?</p><p>Can you keep a secret? - Um... Sure.</p><p>That&#39;s ADD medication.</p><p>Oh, my kids take this or they almost did.</p><p>I thought it was supposed to calmed you down.</p><p>Has the opposite effect if you don&#39;t have ADD.</p><p>Ever chug a pot of Turkish coffee?</p><p>Seriously? You&#39;re taking your kids&#39; medication?</p><p>Once in a while. Do you want a couple?</p><p>Oh, that&#39;s very kind of you but I just</p><p>smoked some crack a little while ago. So.</p><p>I&#39;d better not mix.</p><p>This is what we will do. I&#39;ll sell some old jewelry.</p><p>Pay off the credit card, and Carlos will never find out.</p><p>You would do that for me?</p><p>Of course I would. Why wouldn&#39;t I?</p><p>For starters, you hate me.</p><p>Oh, that is overstating it... a little.</p><p>The bottom line is, no matter how much I dislike you,</p><p>I love Carlos more.</p><p>If Carlos finds out the money, he&#39;ll be devastated.</p><p>I don&#39;t wanna see him hurt.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to believe I&#39;m a good person,</p><p>but at least believe I care about my husband.</p><p>Fine. To heck with it.</p><p>I&#39;m not gonna risk my neck to protect you.</p><p>I&#39;m calling Carlos.</p><p>Juanita might have ben the gambler of the family...</p><p>Wait. I believe you.</p><p>...but Gabrielle was</p><p>the one who knew how to bluff.</p><p>Hi. I&#39;m Susan Mayer.</p><p>I have an appointment to see Dr. Sicher.</p><p>Yes, he&#39;s expecting you. Let me get him for you.</p><p>Hi. I&#39;m Dr. Sicher. - Susan Mayer.</p><p>So you&#39;re doing research for a children&#39;s book?</p><p>I sure am.</p><p>Zach?</p><p>Oh. Hi, Julie.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong with you?</p><p>Just all the pills they make me take.</p><p>They kinda make me sleepy.</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>I came to see how you were.</p><p>And to ask you something.</p><p>Look, I don&#39;t have much time.</p><p>What is it?</p><p>Last week you told Mrs. Van de Kamp</p><p>your mom killed herself</p><p>because of something you did, something bad.</p><p>What were you talking about?</p><p>After my mom died, I started remembering</p><p>things that happened when I was little.</p><p>What happened to Dana. - Dana? Who&#39;s Dana?</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>I was just visiting my friend.</p><p>This patient is not allowed visitors.</p><p>I guess I have to go.</p><p>I am so sorry, Zach.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to disturb you.</p><p>I just left some important papers here.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>I&#39;m repairing a chipped mug.</p><p>Why don&#39;t you just buy a new one?</p><p>Because I think it&#39;s better to fix what you already have.</p><p>Listen. Um...</p><p>About what happened today.</p><p>You humiliated me, Rex.</p><p>For no good reason.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. - I was there. I was willing.</p><p>Normal men don&#39;t say no to that.</p><p>You... You upset me.</p><p>See, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the reason.</p><p>After I left the motel,</p><p>I did some thinking about us and our sex life.</p><p>I realized there has been a disconnect.</p><p>But it&#39;s coming from you. - That&#39;s ridiculous.</p><p>how many years we&#39;ve been making love</p><p>and you&#39;ve started to ask me something</p><p>but then you stopped.</p><p>I... I don&#39;t know what you are talking about?</p><p>You are unhappy with our sex life</p><p>because you&#39;re not getting something from me</p><p>but you&#39;re simplely too afraid to ask.</p><p>My problem with our sex life is that you can&#39;t stop</p><p>thinking about the housework.</p><p>Well, if that&#39;s the case,</p><p>then take me right here, right now.</p><p>The house is spotless.</p><p>There are no burritos around to pull my focus.</p><p>I&#39;m not in the mood. - Why not?</p><p>We haven&#39;t had sex for months, Rex.</p><p>Most normal, red-blooded men</p><p>would be climbing the walls by now.</p><p>Please don&#39;t do this.</p><p>Rex, whatever you want.</p><p>I will go there with you. You just have to say it out loud.</p><p>Tell me. What do you want? What do you need?</p><p>I need for you to stop talking like this.</p><p>Why? - Because you sound like a whore.</p><p>No, I sound like a woman</p><p>whose husband won&#39;t touch her.</p><p>Rex, after Mary Alice killed herself,</p><p>it all hit me.</p><p>We all have our secrets.</p><p>I think it&#39;s time for you to tell me yours.</p><p>I&#39;m going.</p><p>That night, while most of Wisteria Lane</p><p>dreamt the night away,</p><p>Lynette was in the middle of her own personal nightmare.</p><p>Determined her boys would not miss their fairy-tale debut,</p><p>Lynette had stayed up 18 hours straight, sewing.</p><p>But she began to fear her story</p><p>would not have a happy ending.</p><p>Luckily for Lynette, she had a magic potion handy.</p><p>And once she had taken it...</p><p>The magic kept working...</p><p>And working...</p><p>And working.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t until noon that Lynette finally took a break,</p><p>and the reality of what she had done began to sink in.</p><p>My. What big eyes you have.</p><p>I&#39;m going to the store. Do you need anything?</p><p>I&#39;m fine, thank you.</p><p>So what&#39;s been going on with her?</p><p>Have you found anything out yet?</p><p>Actually, Carlos, the more I watch her, the more</p><p>I think she&#39;s probably not stepping out on you.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Yeah. She&#39;s not perfect, Lord knows.</p><p>But she loves you. I can tell.</p><p>Mama. You don&#39;t know what a relief it is to hear that.</p><p>You know, it&#39;s funny. I really think she loves you, too.</p><p>Oh?</p><p>I got concerned when I heard you</p><p>played poker with her friends.</p><p>So I told her about your little problem.</p><p>You told her about my gambling problem?</p><p>Don&#39;t be mad, Mama. I just didn&#39;t want</p><p>you slipping into old habits.</p><p>And Gabrielle was very concerned about you. - She knew?</p><p>I don&#39;t get it. You and Zach never went</p><p>to school with anybody named Dana.</p><p>He didn&#39;t say it was somebody we went to school with.</p><p>Did it sound like a relative?</p><p>He said Dana. It sounded like &quot;Dana&quot;.</p><p>Unless he was using a code,</p><p>that&#39;s all I got.</p><p>Ok, give me a break here. I&#39;m just grasping at straws.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m worried about Zach.</p><p>It&#39;s really creepy in there.</p><p>Can&#39;t we get him out?</p><p>Honey, that&#39;s up to his father.</p><p>Then I want to visit again.</p><p>That&#39;s not a good idea either.</p><p>Why?</p><p>I just have a feeling.</p><p>Juanita was now more convinced than ever</p><p>that her treacherous daughter-in-law was having an affair.</p><p>But the question remained, with whom?</p><p>And suddenly...</p><p>Juanita remembered</p><p>it wasn&#39;t the men Gabrielle talked to</p><p>that she had to worry about.</p><p>Hey, Jordana, Maisy.</p><p>Here are the costumes. Right on time.</p><p>Thank you, Lynette.</p><p>This is a bit awkward.</p><p>There has been an oversight with the programs.</p><p>Celia Bond is still credited with costumes.</p><p>They forgot to tell the printer.</p><p>Incidentally, who is &quot;they&quot;,</p><p>as in, &quot;they forgot to tell the printer&quot;?</p><p>That would be me. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>But I was so overworked this week with</p><p>all the script changes you demanded.</p><p>Uh-huh. Well, these things happen.</p><p>Be right back.</p><p>Would you do something with this?</p><p>It looks like road kill.</p><p>Ok, lady, that&#39;s it.</p><p>I beg your pardon?</p><p>We have kids the same age.</p><p>Which means there&#39;re years ahead of us</p><p>having to deal with each other.</p><p>So instead of playing petty games,</p><p>why don&#39;t we put an end to this right now?</p><p>What are you saying? - Let&#39;s take it outside.</p><p>Let&#39;s take what outside?</p><p>Your sorry ass. We&#39;re throwin&#39; down.</p><p>You are crazy. - Just being practical.</p><p>Isn&#39;t it better to settle this once in fraw</p><p>rather than endure all this Alpha-Mom crap</p><p>until our kids graduate?</p><p>Come on.

She poisons herself with arsenic.</p><p>Really? - You didn&#39;t read until the end?</p><p>I stopped after page 50.</p><p>Am I the only one who read the book?</p><p>I saw the movie.

He broke the boy&#39;s nose.</p><p>Because of our no tolerance policy,</p><p>your son may face expulsion.</p><p>You&#39;re gonna ruin his future over roughhousing?</p><p>Rex, this was practically assault.</p><p>Mrs. Stark, what Andrew did was clearly wrong.</p><p>But in his defence, his mother and I are going</p><p>through severe marital problems.</p><p>Is that relevant?</p><p>Our marriage is disintegrating.</p><p>Of course Andrew is acting out. He has every right to be angry.</p><p>If he&#39;s angry about you moving out the house,</p><p>perhaps he should shove your head into a locker.</p><p>All I&#39;m saying is we need to take some of the responsibility here.</p><p>So does Andrew. Blaming his actions on our problems,</p><p>which are not serious, does not help him.</p><p>Our problems are serious.</p><p>Mrs. Stark, you handle this however you see fit.</p><p>Bree, I&#39;ve gone to an attorney.</p><p>You&#39;re gonna be served with divorce papers later today.</p><p>You went to an attorney? - Yeah.</p><p>And a good one, too.</p><p>He&#39;d better be, &#39;cause when I&#39;m finished with you,</p><p>you won&#39;t have a cent to your name.</p><p>Bring it on.</p><p>Perhaps detention is the way to go.</p><p>Mom, you&#39;re getting too dressed up.</p><p>I know, but I wanna look really sexy.</p><p>I told my guys perheps you have to go home by 11</p><p>Hm. How about midnight?</p><p>All right, but no later.</p><p>You know how I worry. So, you got protection?</p><p>Oh, my god! We are so not having this conversation.</p><p>We are, because I enjoy being an only child.</p><p>Are you finished? - Almost.</p><p>You know I always assumed I&#39;d have sex for the first time</p><p>before you had it again.</p><p>Ok, you can leave now.</p><p>What do you think? Trying too hard?</p><p>What do you know?</p><p>It&#39;s 80 degrees outside and you&#39;re wearing fur.</p><p>Hi, Mike.</p><p>Hey, Edie.</p><p>Wow! Get a load of you! You look so pretty!</p><p>I hardly recognize you. - Oh, this?</p><p>Well, I have a date. Right now. With Mike.</p><p>We kissed, F.Y.I.</p><p>Oh, love that jacket. Good choice.</p><p>Um, Susan, I am really sorry, but I&#39;ve got to cancel.</p><p>I have an unexpected house guest.</p><p>Coming through. Ooh, sorry. Hi. I&#39;m Kendra.</p><p>Susan.</p><p>I&#39;m going to run to the car and get my stuff.</p><p>I know how this looks,</p><p>but there&#39;s nothing between us.</p><p>Kendra&#39;s just an old friend. - Old friend.</p><p>Yeah, you know...</p><p>Yeah, yeah... No, actually, no, I don&#39;t know.</p><p>By old friend you mean college pal?</p><p>Bowling buddy?</p><p>Saved you from drowning?</p><p>It&#39;s hard to explain. - Could you give it a shot?</p><p>Mike, I&#39;m gonna go upstairs and take a shower.</p><p>Look, I promise I&#39;ll make this up to you.</p><p>And... You look amazing. - Mike! where are the towels?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Hey. How was your big date?</p><p>Mike had to reschedule.</p><p>Oh. Because of the hot girl?</p><p>With the suitcase? Over there?</p><p>Gosh, how devastating for you... F.Y.I.</p><p>I just want to move this place fast.</p><p>I&#39;ll do whatever we have to do.</p><p>That&#39;s good to know.</p><p>You do realize that you&#39;ll have to disclose the fact that</p><p>your wife killed herself in the house.</p><p>I am? - Oh, yeah. Legal crap.</p><p>People get really freaked out by suicides.</p><p>You can&#39;t blame them.</p><p>Hell. I get the willies just standing here.</p><p>Is there any way to get around it? - Off the record?</p><p>You could say that she shot herself in the living room</p><p>and then crawled out back to die.</p><p>I&#39;m just saying.</p><p>Oh, I gotta go. I&#39;ll call you tomorrow.</p><p>Edie, wait!</p><p>Paul had always known</p><p>Edie britt was capable of doing anything to close a deal.</p><p>But now he realized she was capable of so much more.</p><p>Hey, Danielle. - Hey, Mrs. Solis.</p><p>Oh, Danielle,</p><p>remember when you said you wanted to be a model?</p><p>You remember? That was last summer.</p><p>Well, as it turns out, Perchik Modeling Academy</p><p>has an opening for their summer program.</p><p>Would you like me to sponsor you?</p><p>Oh my god. That&#39;s one of the best schools in the country.</p><p>You would do that for me? - I sure would.</p><p>I would so love to go to New York.</p><p>Oh, and I would so love to help you get there.</p><p>Hey, Jordana. - Hey, Lynette. How are you?</p><p>You look a little tired. Is everything ok?</p><p>I&#39;m getting ready for a dinner party tomorrow. Six people.</p><p>Sounds fun. - Big fun.</p><p>You wouldn&#39;t have any of your kids&#39;</p><p>ADD medication you could spare,</p><p>just to get me over the hump?</p><p>Tina! Don&#39;t push your sister.</p><p>Gosh, Lynette... I&#39;m really running low.</p><p>I need all my energy I can get.</p><p>My sister Elaine and her kids</p><p>are flying into town for a week.</p><p>That&#39;s exciting. I wish my sister would visit more often.</p><p>Yeah, sisters are great.</p><p>Three or four pills. I&#39;m hitting the wall.</p><p>Yeah, the calm down can be a real bitch. I wish I could help.</p><p>I&#39;m not gonna forget about this, Jordana.</p><p>What&#39;s that supposed to mean?</p><p>Come girl scout cookie time, don&#39;t bring around little Tina</p><p>Because we won&#39;t be home.</p><p>What&#39;s all this about?</p><p>You know your mother and I have been unhappy for a while.</p><p>After a lot of soul-searching,</p><p>we&#39;ve decided that it would be better if we got divorced.</p><p>But whatever problems your father and I may have,</p><p>it doesn&#39;t change the fact that we love you very, very much.</p><p>I&#39;ve got a question. - Go ahead. Ask whatever you want.</p><p>Can I live with dad?</p><p>Come on, mom, let&#39;s face it.</p><p>We drive each other crazy.</p><p>Danielle, is that what you&#39;d prefer?</p><p>Danielle? To live with your father?</p><p>I don&#39;t really care, as long as I have my own bathroom.</p><p>Um... All this, um... wine is,</p><p>uh... giving me a... headache.</p><p>Six weeks in the suburban jungle, and this is all you got?</p><p>There are over 300 families in this subdivision.</p><p>It&#39;ll take time to check them all out.</p><p>Dad said last time he saw you, you were ready to quit.</p><p>Now I changed my mind.</p><p>This is a gigantic waste of your time and my father&#39;s money.</p><p>Are you afraid he&#39;ll spend your inheritance?</p><p>That&#39;s not funny.</p><p>Mike, here&#39;s the thing. - What?</p><p>Dad can&#39;t chase ghosts alone.</p><p>If you stop, he&#39;ll have to accept it&#39;s over.</p><p>Let me have my father back.</p><p>If I quit he&#39;ll just hire somebody else.</p><p>Not if you tell him there&#39;s nothing here to find.</p><p>I can&#39;t do that.</p><p>What happens when your girlfriend finds out</p><p>you&#39;re not just the sweet, neighborly plumber?</p><p>You&#39;re lying to her, Mike.</p><p>Oh, here it is.</p><p>Great. This&#39;ll keep the crab dip warm.</p><p>It took forever to shell the little buggers,</p><p>But it&#39;ll be worth it.</p><p>You shelled your own crabs?</p><p>Okay, I don&#39;t want to butt in.</p><p>Are you doing too much? Cause you look exhausted.</p><p>I&#39;m fine. I just need some coffee. Thank you.</p><p>Oh, my god! Look at this embroidery!</p><p>&quot;Dana.&quot; Where did this come from?</p><p>Paul Young&#39;s garage sale.</p><p>Dana.</p><p>Dana was a baby.</p><p>Surprise.</p><p>No way! - It&#39;s all yours. Here are the keys.</p><p>Rex, what&#39;s this about?</p><p>I went and splurged a little.</p><p>Oh, Danielle, here&#39;s your present.</p><p>Luggage? - Yeah.</p><p>It&#39;s to take with you to the Perchik Modeling Academy.</p><p>I&#39;m footing the bill.</p><p>You mean I can go to New York? - Wait a minute.</p><p>What&#39;s this about a modeling academy?</p><p>It&#39;s my new career. Mrs. Solis is sponsoring me.</p><p>When were you planning on telling me?</p><p>She told me, I think it&#39;s a great idea.</p><p>Don&#39;t you two see what he&#39;s doing?</p><p>He&#39;s trying to buy your love.</p><p>For god&#39;s sake. Don&#39;t be paranoid.</p><p>A car? A modeling academy?</p><p>You should have discussed these gifts with me first.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, kids. But we cannot accept them.</p><p>You can&#39;t let her do this.</p><p>Bree, we just told the kids we&#39;re getting divorced.</p><p>Isn&#39;t it time to spoil them a little? - I said no.</p><p>You know what? They&#39;re my kids too,</p><p>and I can give them anything I want.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>Thank you, daddy. - Yes.</p><p>Did you offer to help Danielle get into modeling school?</p><p>What? Uh... Yes... No.</p><p>Um... is that how she heard it?</p><p>Yes. Gabrielle, did you or did you not offer to sponsor her?</p><p>I just wanted to help out.</p><p>It&#39;s in New York! For god sakes</p><p>Why would you suggest that?</p><p>It&#39;s her dream. Don&#39;t you want her to be happy?</p><p>No. And in the future I would appreciate you keeping</p><p>your ridiculous ideas to yourself.</p><p>Bree!</p><p>John.</p><p>John!</p><p>You&#39;re so jealous of Danielle.</p><p>You tried to ship her off to New York?</p><p>I&#39;m not jealous. I just don&#39;t like to share.</p><p>Well, you know what? I quit.</p><p>The yard. Us. Everything.</p><p>Oh, don&#39;t be that way.</p><p>What&#39;s the point, if we can never be together?</p><p>You know, an hour here, an hour there.</p><p>I don&#39;t want us to end on a bad note.</p><p>Carlos has this black tie thing tonight and I could slip out...</p><p>Mrs. Solis! - John, please.</p><p>What we had was so special.</p><p>I think it deserves a proper goodbye.</p><p>We&#39;d, um... we&#39;d still be over, though.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>I knew this play day was a good idea.</p><p>Oh, yeah. Thank you for suggesting it.</p><p>Your boys are the only ones I know who could tire out Timmy.</p><p>Yep, he&#39;s a feisty one.</p><p>Word on the street is, um, you&#39;ve been medicating Timmy?</p><p>Oh, yeah. For his ADD.</p><p>The pills have been a godsend. - I bet.</p><p>Can I use your bathroom?</p><p>As Lynette swallowed the stolen</p><p>medication of an eight-year-old child.</p><p>She vowed she&#39;d never again sink to such depths</p><p>any time soon.</p><p>Looks like you&#39;ve got your blackmailer.</p><p>Is it time to bring in the police?</p><p>That&#39;s not really an option for me.</p><p>Before my wife shot herself,</p><p>we lived a life that I was proud of.</p><p>We loved each other. We had values.</p><p>We went to church. We gave to charity.</p><p>We were good people, Mr. Shaw.</p><p>Oh, I believe you.</p><p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s so incomprehensible to me that</p><p>Edie Britt would try to destroy us.</p><p>Well, you&#39;ve suffered a great loss.</p><p>For your pain to heal, that&#39;s gonna take some time.</p><p>I can&#39;t wait.</p><p>I need help now.</p><p>For five grand she&#39;s hurt, ten grand she&#39;s gone.</p><p>Mom, what&#39;s going on?</p><p>Oh, I&#39;m throwing you out.</p><p>I&#39;ve separated all your things into two sides.</p><p>This side is yours, Danielle,</p><p>and the other one is Andrew&#39;s.</p><p>Ok, you&#39;ve lost it. - Where are we supposed to live?</p><p>Darling, if I know.</p><p>Danielle, everything in the north quadrant</p><p>of your side is clothes and books and such.</p><p>The south side are miscellaneous items.</p><p>Mom, this isn&#39;t gonna work. I&#39;m not giving up my car.</p><p>That&#39;s smart. Because you&#39;ll probably gonna</p><p>have to sleep in it for a while.</p><p>Mom, you can&#39;t stop us from going back inside the house.</p><p>No? That&#39;s Mr. Conlin, the locksmith.</p><p>He&#39;s been very helpful today.</p><p>Of couse I could give you the new keys</p><p>if you&#39;d adhere to my rules,</p><p>Which include giving back your father&#39;s gifts.</p><p>Ok, fine. You win. I won&#39;t go to New York.</p><p>I&#39;m outta here.</p><p>Oh, hello. Welcome. I&#39;m Edie. How do you do?</p><p>An open house in the suburbs? This is beyond kitsch.</p><p>Just behavior yourself.</p><p>This is one of the houses in the street</p><p>I&#39;ve had a hard time getting into.</p><p>God, I wish you would let this go.</p><p>I&#39;m taking you out for drinks tonight.</p><p>There&#39;s this cowboy bar called Saddle Ranch, you need to see.</p><p>Why?</p><p>It&#39;s the last place anybody ever saw your sister.</p><p>Susan. What brings you here?</p><p>I just wanted to say goodbye to Mary Alice&#39;s house</p><p>before somebody else moved in.</p><p>That sounds almost plausible.</p><p>I beg your pardon? - Oh, come on.</p><p>We both know why you&#39;re here.</p><p>And the answer is yes, they are having sex. No question.</p><p>You know what you are talking about, they&#39;re just friends.</p><p>Hm. Think so?</p><p>I over heared they say they&#39;re going to the Saddle Ranch tonight,</p><p>for drinks and dancing.</p><p>Still, friends can do that.</p><p>Oh, my god, I just want to slap and shake you.</p><p>Where did you say they were going tonight?</p><p>I don&#39;t know why I let you talk me into coming here?</p><p>There is obviously nothing going on between them.</p><p>Where are you going?</p><p>I&#39;m going to the bathroom and then I&#39;m going home.</p><p>I don&#39;t want Mike to catch me here.</p><p>It&#39;s only been ten minutes.</p><p>She could be waiting to make her move.</p><p>Oh, come on. You&#39;re not gonna beat a girl like that</p><p>by knocking off early.</p><p>It&#39;s not a competition. - The hell it isn&#39;t.</p><p>Good night, Edie.</p><p>Suit yourself. But for the record...</p><p>I was rooting for you to land him.</p><p>And why would you root for me?</p><p>I figured it&#39;d be easier for me</p><p>to steal Mike from you than her.</p><p>She seems like fun.</p><p>Just take some antacid. - It&#39;s not those kind of cramps.</p><p>This is a business dinner. It&#39;s important.</p><p>Relax.</p><p>You and I can go alone.</p><p>Gabrielle can stay here and get better.</p><p>Fine. See you in a couple of hours. - Ok.</p><p>Take good care of Carlos. - Oh, I always do.</p><p>Go, Edie!</p><p>Oh, god.</p><p>Mike!</p><p>What a small, small world.</p><p>Yeah, it sure is. I caught Edie hiding in the back.</p><p>No kidding. Is she here?</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, she said, &quot;the jig is up,&quot;</p><p>and then she went to ride the bull.</p><p>And she said you two came together. - Oh, well, yeah.</p><p>We did. I just thought she left.</p><p>Were you following me? - What?</p><p>No! No, I just came here, you know, with Edie.</p><p>We just love to ride that bull.</p><p>You? Ride the bull? - Yeah. Yeah, it&#39;s a real rush.</p><p>Come on, Susan. Give me a break.</p><p>You give me a break. I did not follow you here.</p><p>Even if I had followed you here, it&#39;s just because</p><p>you&#39;ve been secretive about Kendra.</p><p>Kendra and I are friends.</p><p>And I came here to ride the bull.</p><p>Whoo! We got another one to ride the bull!</p><p>Ok, little doggie, you&#39;re up.</p><p>Oh, fine. I&#39;m a doggie.</p><p>Oh, yeah. I&#39;m here to ride this bull.</p><p>Check it out. Whoo!</p><p>Baby! whoo!</p><p>Andrew, you promised you&#39;d stay with your mother</p><p>that&#39;s why I gave you the car.</p><p>Dad, she wants me out.</p><p>She put all my stuff on the front lawn.</p><p>This is ridiculous.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna call her and smooth all this out.</p><p>You&#39;re going home. - No, dad.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Now I can live with you without feeling guilty.</p><p>We&#39;ll be perfect. It&#39;ll be like our own little bachelor pad.</p><p>What? - Son, that&#39;s not gonna happen.</p><p>Why not? - Andrew...</p><p>These last few months have been incredibly difficult for me.</p><p>There are things I&#39;ve got to work out for myself</p><p>and I can&#39;t do it if you&#39;re living with me. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m not going back there.</p><p>I don&#39;t think you have a choice. - But, Dad...</p><p>Oh, Come on now. Don&#39;t...</p><p>Heath? Yeah, it&#39;s me.</p><p>Do you still have your fake ID?</p><p>Yeah. I&#39;ve got to go home and kiss my mother&#39;s ass</p><p>and I&#39;m not going to do it sober.</p><p>... More than I needed to know.</p><p>He was in shock. He was totally shocked.</p><p>He said, &quot;Congressman, this was the campaign</p><p>This was not the vote. You voted already.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s what it was. - I love that one!</p><p>Oh, the desserts look wonderful.</p><p>Lynette, Do you need any help?</p><p>I got it covered. No problem.</p><p>Ok, Scavo. You&#39;re up. Let&#39;s hear this genius idea of yours.</p><p>Ok. Uh...</p><p>Ok.</p><p>The single greatest obstacle facing Spotless Scrub</p><p>is a lack of visibility</p><p>We need to concentrate ad spending in places</p><p>where women spend the majority of their time.</p><p>For example, large chain grocery stores.</p><p>Picture spotless scrub ads on the</p><p>side of every mother&#39;s shopping cart.</p><p>Interesting. - Oh, You know what&#39;d be even better?</p><p>Dry-cleaning bags. - What?</p><p>No, Really. Hear me out.</p><p>Put a big Spotless Scrub ad</p><p>between a woman and her cashmere sweater.</p><p>I gurantee you&#39;ll get her attention.</p><p>Honey. That&#39;s great. I&#39;m I&#39;m in the middle of a thing here.</p><p>She&#39;s got a point. I would notice that.</p><p>And those dry-cleaning bags hang in our closets forever.</p><p>So it is like constant advertising. - Exactly!</p><p>You know, maybe that&#39;s the way we can work that in, but...</p><p>No, this is kind of a fantastic idea.</p><p>We go nationwide with this?</p><p>Why not? Start by targeting the top chain.</p><p>Then branch out from there.</p><p>Boom, boom, boom. Mass saturation.</p><p>And you know what else would be a great idea?</p><p>While Lynette was commanding everyone&#39;s attention...</p><p>Susan was trying to remain inconspicuous.</p><p>Everybody&#39;s looking at me, aren&#39;t they?</p><p>Just the slapstick fans.</p><p>Oh, god, why couldn&#39;t I have just been knocked unconscious?</p><p>Beer? - Absolutely.</p><p>Susan, this is Kendra. - We&#39;ve been introduced.</p><p>No.This is Kendra. We&#39;ve been friends for years.</p><p>She&#39;s only visit. She&#39;s leaving tomorrow</p><p>That&#39;s it. - It&#39;s true.</p><p>I have no designs on this man whatsoever.</p><p>I&#39;ll be right back.</p><p>Sorry about the misunderstanding. - Me, too.</p><p>So how long have you two been seeing each other?</p><p>Well, you sort of interrupted our first date.</p><p>But up until then, smoking-hot tension.</p><p>Sounds pathetic, I know.</p><p>No, it&#39;s good to take it slow.</p><p>You&#39;d be smart to be careful.</p><p>Any particular reason? - Look...</p><p>Mike&#39;s a wonderful guy. Really.</p><p>But you should ask him why he moved to Wisteria Lane.</p><p>It&#39;s one hell of a story.</p><p>Here. Got some ice.</p><p>There you go. - Thanks.</p><p>Well, it&#39;s been fun. Thanks, guys. See you later.</p><p>Good evening. - Good evening.</p><p>Have a seat.</p><p>I could get used to this whole closure thing.</p><p>I love long goodbyes.</p><p>Wait around the corner. I&#39;ll be right back.</p><p>Smile, Gabrielle.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s it, then.</p><p>What are you doing? She had a camera.</p><p>We&#39;ve got to catch her.</p><p>Mrs. Solis, your husband&#39;s going to kill us.</p><p>Come on!</p><p>Leave me alone. - Give me that camera!</p><p>I&#39;m not kidding, old woman!</p><p>Stay away from me! Don&#39;t touch me!</p><p>No.</p><p>No, you go home. I&#39;ll take care of this.</p><p>And you were never here. Go.</p><p>Go!</p><p>Did you see that? A guy came barreling</p><p>around the corner and just hit her.</p><p>Do you have a cell phone? - Yeah.</p><p>Call 911.</p><p>What happened? - Is she breathing?</p><p>As Juanita Tetered dangerously close to the white light,</p><p>Lynette and Tom were headed into a black hole.</p><p>I was just participating.</p><p>Your participation was supposed</p><p>to be limited to making dinner,</p><p>not making my ideas look bad.</p><p>You konw. Maybe you need better ideas.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean that.</p><p>No, we both know that your career</p><p>was going so much better than mine before we had kids.</p><p>You never let me forget that. - That is not fair.</p><p>You were always competing with me,</p><p>and judging by tonight, you konw what, still are.</p><p>Tom, I am sorry about tonight. Truly.</p><p>But these days if I&#39;m competing with anyone</p><p>it&#39;s the Bree Van de Kamps of the world,</p><p>with their spotless kitchens and their perfect kids,</p><p>who throw fabulous parties where nothing ever goes wrong.</p><p>I try so hard to keep up but I can&#39;t.</p><p>Lynette. That&#39;s not my expectation.</p><p>And when you work on a pitch, you bring the parteners over.</p><p>I am reminded of a world I left behind,</p><p>where I was the winner and people tried to keep up with me.</p><p>I can&#39;t go back, I can&#39;t win where I am.</p><p>I am stuck in the middle</p><p>and it&#39;s really something that gets me...</p><p>Whoa! For your information,</p><p>I thought you threw an amazing dinner party tonight.</p><p>I was thrilled.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how you pulled it all together.</p><p>Yeah, well... - And whether you believe it or not,</p><p>everyone who knows you thinks that</p><p>you are a great wife and mother.</p><p>No, they don&#39;t. - Yes, they do.</p><p>Especially me.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong with your eyes?</p><p>Nothing. I&#39;m tired.</p><p>Turn around. I want to look at you. - I&#39;m fine. Really</p><p>What&#39;s going on outside?</p><p>Right there.</p><p>Oh my god. Thank god you&#39;re here.</p><p>Will you take care of Gabrielle? I have to come home for a minute.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Oh, Andrew. Thank god you&#39;re back.</p><p>I need your help, honey.</p><p>There&#39;s been an accident.</p><p>Andrew?</p><p>Mama?</p><p>Andrew!</p><p>Rex, you need to come home.</p><p>Something&#39;s happened and we need you.</p><p>Competition.

This is a residential neighborhood!</p><p>That&#39;s quite a pitching arm you&#39;ve got there.</p><p>It pisses me off. I&#39;ve got four kids.</p><p>I was up all night reading statistics online.</p><p>One out of every four traffic accidents</p><p>happens on residential streets.</p><p>I hope whoever hit Juanita gets put away for life.</p><p>Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a little bit extreme?</p><p>An innocent woman gets hit by a car and</p><p>the driver takes off? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s extreme.</p><p>You should go home and get some rest. Eat something.</p><p>You have ton of messages from work.</p><p>Tanaka called. Said it was urgent.</p><p>Carlos, I can stay here with your mother.</p><p>I need to be here if she wakes up.</p><p>You can&#39;t go on like this.You have to take care of yourself.</p><p>And what if she dies?</p><p>People slip into comas all the time and never come out.</p><p>Don&#39;t say that.

Why?</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>I am taking back the $40 you stole out of my purse.</p><p>Edie! - We both know you did it. Now hand it over!</p><p>I have taken nothing from your purse.</p><p>If you&#39;re missing money, I&#39;d ask one</p><p>of those strange men you parade through here at all hours.</p><p>I am not going to apologize for having a healthy sex life.</p><p>Healthy? I&#39;m going to have to burn every sheet you&#39;ve touched.</p><p>I want my money. - And I want those non-fat peach yogurts.</p><p>They didn&#39;t just walk out of that fridge by themselves.</p><p>You can deduct it from the $40</p><p>that you&#39;re going to give me now.</p><p>You&#39;re my best friend. Why would I steal from you?</p><p>It&#39;s no secret that you&#39;ve been having financial problems.</p><p>I hear you bitching on the phone to your bank.</p><p>that&#39;s it.</p><p>I can put up with your debauchery and your food theft,</p><p>but I will not tolerate spying.</p><p>I want you out. - You don&#39;t mean that.</p><p>Oh, yes, I do. I&#39;m leaving tomorrow</p><p>to visit my sister for a few days.</p><p>I want you gone by the time I get back.</p><p>I&#39;ll do you one better.</p><p>I will leave today.</p><p>I hope this works.</p><p>My sleep cycle&#39;s totally out of whack.</p><p>I&#39;m up all night, then dozing off during the day.</p><p>Trust me. This will do the trick.</p><p>In fact, you should be feeling more relaxed already.</p><p>You know, you&#39;re right.</p><p>Boys, I can hear you out there!</p><p>Now be quiet! Just sit there and color.</p><p>Now is not a good time to be moving. - I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>Just block everything out</p><p>and let it go.</p><p>Imagine that you&#39;re in a forest.</p><p>There&#39;s a babbling brook nearby.</p><p>And the wind is just coming through the trees...</p><p>Mommy? - Parker!</p><p>I don&#39;t know... ow! ...what you think you&#39;re doing,</p><p>but put that back where it belongs.</p><p>Sorry. You were saying something about wind.</p><p>I was just creating a soothing image.</p><p>Oh, for the love of god.</p><p>Knock it off, you little monsters.</p><p>Mrs. Scavo, please lie down. We need to finish this.</p><p>I&#39;m on my last nerves, so I&#39;m gonna level with you here.</p><p>I&#39;ve screwed up my entire system by</p><p>taking my kids&#39; A.D.D. Medication.</p><p>Yeah, that&#39;s right, you heard me. I plan to stop.</p><p>But right now I need to sleep</p><p>and I need more than a few crappy needles, so what do you got?</p><p>I&#39;m not licensed to write prescriptions.</p><p>I know you&#39;re not.</p><p>This will put you right to sleep.</p><p>It&#39;s a very powerful herbal remedy.</p><p>Promise me you&#39;ll use it judiciously.</p><p>Sure. Whatever.</p><p>Knock, knock!</p><p>Hey, come on in. - You&#39;re a mess.</p><p>I&#39;m tearing out the leaky pipes in the upstairs bathroom.</p><p>Wall-to-wall rotten wood.</p><p>Sounds like a job.</p><p>So Julie said that you came by before.</p><p>Um... Yeah.</p><p>I was thinking about driving up to</p><p>the Germani Vineyard tomorrow for this wine tasting and...</p><p>What time do you want me to be ready?</p><p>About 6:00. - Six is good.</p><p>All right.</p><p>I thought maybe afterwards we could have a little dinner,</p><p>maybe some dancing.</p><p>Sounds great.</p><p>You do know that it&#39;s like a two-hour drive up there.</p><p>And isn&#39;t that kind of late to be coming back?</p><p>I thought if worse came to worse we could... grab a room.</p><p>Oh? Like a hotel room?</p><p>Yeah. As a last resort. - Of course. Of course. Yes.</p><p>So maybe we should make a reservation.</p><p>You know, just in case.</p><p>Yeah, I found some hotels online.</p><p>Let me get the print-out.</p><p>Hey, Bongo. Come here. Do you want a treat?</p><p>Where do you keep the dog biscuits? - Sorry, what?</p><p>Oh, never mind.</p><p>We&#39;ll just find them ourselves, huh?</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, Susan. I couldn&#39;t hear you. What did you say?</p><p>Nothing. It&#39;s not important.</p><p>It&#39;s my tiler guy. Here. See what looks good.</p><p>Hey, Phil.</p><p>No, tomorrow morning I&#39;m making a lumber run.</p><p>That&#39;s no good.</p><p>No, I&#39;m gone tomorrow night, too.</p><p>I could let him in. - No, it&#39;s ok. Thanks.</p><p>It&#39;s fine.</p><p>Just give me the key. I&#39;ll be around all day.</p><p>All right. Thanks.</p><p>Phil, I&#39;ll give a key to my neighbor.</p><p>She&#39;ll be here to let you in.</p><p>Like every city, fairview had a neighborhood</p><p>that was less than desirable.</p><p>It was an accepted fact</p><p>anyone who lingered there after midnight</p><p>was usually up to no good.</p><p>Rex and Bree Van de Kamp were no exception.</p><p>You really think this is gonna work?</p><p>This is an impoverished neighborhood in the city.</p><p>Trust me. Somebody will steal the car.</p><p>How can you be so sure?</p><p>Because I have faith in the poor.</p><p>She&#39;s so beautiful.</p><p>I shot this last year on her birthday.</p><p>How are you going to do it?</p><p>I made contact with her at a bar.</p><p>She thinks I&#39;m a real-estate developer.</p><p>Is she going to suffer? - No.</p><p>Edie Britt will disappear and</p><p>you&#39;ll go back to your life.</p><p>Before you do it, do you think you could ask her</p><p>why she sent this to my wife?</p><p>You can&#39;t think like that, Mr. Young.</p><p>You can&#39;t give in to your curiosity.</p><p>Curiosity leads to guilt.</p><p>Guilt leads to talking.</p><p>Do you still have questions?</p><p>I want to be clear about something.</p><p>If I walk away with this cash, it&#39;s done.</p><p>No refunds. No buyer&#39;s remorse.</p><p>I get it.</p><p>We won&#39;t talk again, so I&#39;ll ask one more time.</p><p>Are you sure you want this?</p><p>My wife is dead because of Edie Britt.</p><p>I absolutely want this.</p><p>You&#39;ve been awfully quiet.</p><p>I&#39;ve just been thinking about the kids.</p><p>They sure grew up quickly, didn&#39;t they?</p><p>They sure did.</p><p>I told them when they were babies</p><p>that they weren&#39;t allowed to get any bigger</p><p>because they were so adorable.</p><p>And we were so happy. - Yeah, well...</p><p>They sure didn&#39;t turn out like we expected them to.</p><p>No. They didn&#39;t.</p><p>Oh, we could have been better parents.</p><p>We weren&#39;t that bad.</p><p>We still have so much to teach them.</p><p>We need to show Andrew the enormity of what he&#39;s done.</p><p>I suppose we could punish him.</p><p>What&#39;s the appropriate punishment for</p><p>a child who drives over a woman?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>No matter how the kids turn out, I still love them.</p><p>Course you do.</p><p>But I&#39;ll never forgive them for growing up so quickly.</p><p>Hey, look.</p><p>And I opened the cabinet and there was all this money in it.</p><p>I mean there was wads of it.</p><p>That&#39;s why you&#39;re freaking out?</p><p>A few stacks of cash? Come on.</p><p>Realistically, I&#39;ve known this guy a few weeks.</p><p>He could be a hit man for the mob.</p><p>If you really think that why are you going on a trip with him?</p><p>I never get out of the house.</p><p>Mom. If you really need something to freak out about,</p><p>just remember that you&#39;re spending the night with Mike.</p><p>No man has seen you naked in years.</p><p>Except your doctor.</p><p>And he retired.</p><p>I try not to take that personally.</p><p>You look old in that.</p><p>Maybe I am being silly.</p><p>But going to a hotel with a man is a big deal to me.</p><p>What if Mike is hiding something?</p><p>Like what? - I don&#39;t know.</p><p>That&#39;s dad. I gotta go.</p><p>Now, listen to me. No more freaking out.</p><p>I need this weekend to go well.</p><p>Why do you care so much?</p><p>Because I&#39;m gonna have a husband some day.</p><p>I really don&#39;t want you living with us.</p><p>Are the Lady Fingers ok? - They&#39;re terrific.</p><p>We just appreciate you all stopping by.</p><p>We just wanted you to know how much we care.</p><p>So have the police come up with any leads?</p><p>Not really. They&#39;ll be able to determine</p><p>the make and model of the car,</p><p>but without any eyewitnesses, no one seems very optimistic.</p><p>More importantly is there any good news about Juanita?</p><p>No change.</p><p>All we can do is wait and hope for the best.</p><p>We put her on our prayer list at church.</p><p>That&#39;s very sweet, Danielle. Thank you.</p><p>It must really help during times like these, having kids.</p><p>Yeah. They&#39;re a blessing.</p><p>Children make everything worthwhile.</p><p>You guys are the future. Legacy.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>After we&#39;re all dead,</p><p>you&#39;ll be the only ones left to carry on.</p><p>Gabrielle and I are about to start a family.</p><p>Oh! Hey, that&#39;s great!</p><p>When did you decide this?</p><p>It&#39;s a fairly recent development.</p><p>I see.</p><p>We&#39;ll talk about this later.</p><p>Face it. We&#39;re shallow people.</p><p>Can our lives have any meaning if all we do is buy stuff?</p><p>That depends on what we buy. - I want a child.</p><p>In case you&#39;ve forgotten,</p><p>before we fot married we made a deal. No kids.</p><p>Deals were meant to be renegotiated.</p><p>We&#39;re not negotiating my uterus.</p><p>We should probably be going.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>That was weird. - I feel awful for Carlos.</p><p>That talk about children is obviously coming from his grief.</p><p>Whatever. I&#39;m off the hook.</p><p>A weary Lynette drank her potent tea</p><p>in hopes of finally finding the sleep that had eluded her.</p><p>Unfortunately for Lynette,</p><p>there would be no rest for the weary.</p><p>Go to hell.</p><p>Go to hell, go to hell.</p><p>Sorry we&#39;re late.</p><p>Kenny Lipman couldn&#39;t find his neckerchief.</p><p>Come on guys</p><p>Lori Jean, the scout meeting is today?</p><p>Mommy! - What? Oh. Right.</p><p>Ok. Boys. This knot is called the bowline.</p><p>It is a remarkably useful knot. Now, pick up your ropes.</p><p>Ok, first we cross this end over here</p><p>and then we make a loop and then another loop</p><p>And then you sort of pull it through, I&#39;m guessing,</p><p>and then you just... ready? ...Yank it taut.</p><p>Mommy, that doesn&#39;t look like the picture.</p><p>You&#39;re never gonna be a sailor. What do you care?</p><p>Ok, everybody. Let&#39;s just take a break.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Ok. It&#39;s all up there. Can I get a signature?</p><p>Oh, of course. - Thank you very much.</p><p>There you go. Have a nice weekend. - You too, lady.</p><p>Hey, ma&#39;am!</p><p>Are you still here? I forgot to give you a receipt.</p><p>Ma&#39;am?</p><p>Hello!</p><p>I need help! I&#39;m up here!</p><p>I&#39;m trapped in the floor! hello!</p><p>If you came in here to judge me, you can just leave.</p><p>Wait! Wait, no! Wait. Don&#39;t go.</p><p>Wait. I have an idea. Here, here, here.</p><p>Here. Grab the towel, Bongo.</p><p>Come on. Grab the other end. Good boy.</p><p>That&#39;s it. Get the other end.</p><p>Come on, Bongo. Pull the other end.</p><p>Come on, Bongo. What are you doing? Bongo, over here.</p><p>Bongo? Oh! Oh! Don&#39;t do that! Oh, Bongo!</p><p>While Susan remained hopelessly stuck,</p><p>Gabrielle was moving to confront the issue</p><p>of her young lover&#39;s restless conscience.</p><p>Nobody&#39;s home.</p><p>I know. I&#39;ve been watching. I came to talk to you.</p><p>Although she would need to be discreet. - Keep working.</p><p>What were you thinking showing up at the hospital?</p><p>I had to see if she was ok.</p><p>You need to keep a low profile right now.</p><p>Look, you and I are finished.</p><p>From now on, I&#39;m sticking with Danielle.</p><p>Why would you say that?</p><p>I hate myself for what we did.</p><p>Ok, I can&#39;t sleep at night. We&#39;ve got to make a clean break.</p><p>We weren&#39;t driving the car.</p><p>We didn&#39;t chase Juanita into the street.</p><p>She wouldn&#39;t have been there if we weren&#39;t having an affair.</p><p>Oh, for god sake. Between you and Carlos!</p><p>Listen to me carefully. You didn&#39;t do anything wrong.</p><p>That&#39;s not what father Crowley thinks. - What?</p><p>I went to confession.</p><p>Have you lost your mind? What did you tell him?</p><p>Everything? - Including...</p><p>in the alley? Behind the truck stop?</p><p>Everything. - Damn you!</p><p>What is wrong with you?</p><p>Lassie would have had a fire truck here by now.</p><p>You stupid dog.</p><p>Good boy, Bongo! Run, Bongo, Run! Go get help!</p><p>Andrew, um...</p><p>I know the last few days have been stressful.</p><p>And you know, if you ever need to talk to anybody...</p><p>I know. You and Dad are here for me.</p><p>Actually, I was thinking we could arrange for you</p><p>to talk to a professional.</p><p>A shrink?</p><p>You think I&#39;m crazy? - Of course not.</p><p>It&#39;s just that the accident probably</p><p>stirred up a lot of emotions.</p><p>And it would be normal for you to be feeling</p><p>confused or depressed or shamed.</p><p>I&#39;m cool. Really.</p><p>Honey. You put a woman into a coma.</p><p>Surely that arouses some kind of emotion.</p><p>Yeah, well, it doesn&#39;t.</p><p>If you&#39;ll excuse me.</p><p>No! I won&#39;t. Not until you tell me.</p><p>Why do you care?</p><p>I need to know you&#39;re not a monster.</p><p>You want to know how I feel? - Yeah.</p><p>Here goes. I feel bad that she got hurt.</p><p>But I also feel bad that my car got dinged</p><p>Because somebody didn&#39;t have the sense to look both ways</p><p>before she cross the street.</p><p>And I feel bad that now I&#39;m gonna have to ride my bike to school.</p><p>Andrew, you almost killed another human being.</p><p>She&#39;s an old lady, ok? She&#39;s lived her life.</p><p>I have my whole life ahead of me</p><p>and now it might be screwed up.</p><p>That&#39;s what you should be worried about.</p><p>What I&#39;m worried about is that</p><p>Andrew you don&#39;t seem to have a soul.</p><p>Give me one good reason why I shouldn&#39;t call the police.</p><p>Because I&#39;m your son. That would make you the monster.</p><p>Hey, buddy.</p><p>Susan, is that you?</p><p>Mike? I&#39;m upstairs. Sort of.</p><p>Hang on. I&#39;ll be right up.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Well, you see. This bird flew in your bathroom window</p><p>and I tried to save it but uh... it died.</p><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what happened.</p><p>I don&#39;t think so either.</p><p>Help me get out of here please. - Come on.</p><p>Oh! God.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Oh. You have no idea what that was like. Oh.</p><p>You went through my cabinets? - What?</p><p>Oh, I can explain that. - Get out of my house.</p><p>Mike... - Get out.</p><p>Hello there! - Good afternoon.</p><p>Oh! Well, isn&#39;t this just as pretty as a picture book?</p><p>The plan is to put in a small condo.</p><p>You want to make some money or you want to pussyfoot around?</p><p>What do you suggest?</p><p>I&#39;m thinking? Strip mall.</p><p>I&#39;ve run some numbers</p><p>Nice stationery. - Oh, it&#39;s stolen.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>After my house burned down,</p><p>I was staying with this neighbour Martha Huber.</p><p>That is until the old troll threw me out.</p><p>Anyway. I&#39;d steal her stuff, she&#39;d steal mine</p><p>It&#39;s the circle of life.</p><p>So this paper is hers?</p><p>Oh, god, Yes.</p><p>No, Tom, you can&#39;t do this to me.</p><p>Because I need you home!</p><p>Boys, stop it! I am on the phone!</p><p>Well. Yeah, I realize it&#39;s not your fault</p><p>that the meeting got postponed</p><p>But you promised you&#39;d be back tonight.</p><p>Mom! - I gotta go.</p><p>The kids are... Yeah.</p><p>I know you&#39;re sorry.</p><p>Just will you try and get back as soon as you can?</p><p>Ok. Bye.</p><p>Boys, would you please, please stop it?</p><p>Really. Mommy&#39;s got a headache, ok? Just...</p><p>Turn that damn thing off!</p><p>What&#39;s the matter with you? Why won&#39;t you listen to me?</p><ul><li><p>All is groovy</p></li><li><p>Slow down, you move too fast</p></li><li><p>You&#39;ve got to make the morning last</p></li><li><p>Just kicking down the cobbled stones</p></li><li><p>Looking for fun and feeling groovy</p></li></ul><p>What?</p><p>I just came over to say I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>And I&#39;ll pay for all the damage.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p>Well... So...</p><p>In your mind, is the date off?</p><p>Well. You snooped around my house and went through my stuff.</p><p>Yeah. That&#39;s pretty much a deal breaker.</p><p>Hold on a minute. I started snooping around because</p><p>I found all that money by accident.</p><p>And then I found a gun.</p><p>Are you a drug dealer? - Is that what you think?</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t know because you never let me in.</p><p>You know this whole part of your life</p><p>that you kept completely walled off.</p><p>I have a gun for protection. I keep cash for emergencies.</p><p>I&#39;m a good guy, Susan, and you should know that.</p><p>I&#39;m not obligated to share every little detail of my life...</p><p>Every little detail is one thing,</p><p>weird creepy secrets, that&#39;s another.</p><p>You know what,</p><p>I don&#39;t wanna be with somebody who doesn&#39;t trust me.</p><p>Well, maybe we shouldn&#39;t be dating.</p><p>Maybe we shouldn&#39;t.</p><p>Do you mean that? - Yeah.</p><p>Well, I hope that your, you know,</p><p>blow secret keeps you warm at night.</p><p>Because you&#39;re throwing something</p><p>really great away to protect it.</p><p>Oh, Susan! You gotta take my kids for a while.</p><p>Lynette, this just really isn&#39;t a good time.</p><p>No, no I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t do this.</p><p>It&#39;s just, it&#39;s too much.</p><p>Boys, you stay with your aunt Susan.</p><p>Lynette, when are you coming back?</p><p>Lynette!</p><p>Lynette!</p><p>There&#39;s Lynette&#39;s car. She&#39;s gotta be close.</p><p>I hope the kids aren&#39;t too much for Danielle to handle.</p><p>She&#39;ll be fine.</p><p>What do you think is happening with Lynette?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. But I&#39;m scared.</p><p>Something&#39;s very, very wrong.</p><p>Lynette? Honey?</p><p>Are you ok?</p><p>Father. I&#39;m so glad you could come and pray for mama.</p><p>Please, sit. - Thank you, Gabrielle.</p><p>Listen, since you&#39;re here.</p><p>There&#39;s something I&#39;ve always wondered about.</p><p>That whole thing about priests not being allowed</p><p>to repeat what they hear in confessions.</p><p>Is that a hard rule or just a general guideline?</p><p>Rest assured, everyone&#39;s secrets are safe.</p><p>That&#39;s good to hear.</p><p>I&#39;ll keep yours too if you want to talk.</p><p>Me? No, no. Confession&#39;s not really my thing.</p><p>That&#39;s a shame.</p><p>Ok, you can stop condemning me with your eyes.</p><p>Right now.</p><p>I know you know about the affair.</p><p>But you know nothing about my life.</p><p>Look, it&#39;s not even an issue any more.</p><p>John and I are finished.</p><p>Gabrielle, the church is pretty clear on this.</p><p>If you commit a mortal sin and you die without repenting,</p><p>You go to hell.</p><p>Well, aren&#39;t you just a ball of fun?</p><p>So if I confess, it&#39;ll clean the slate, right?</p><p>Not only that.</p><p>If you want god&#39;s forgiveness you have to be truly sorry</p><p>and promise not to commit the sin again.</p><p>So what happens if I repent later?</p><p>Like, say, when I&#39;m 75?</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t recommend waiting,</p><p>what if you die before then?</p><p>Well, let&#39;s say I don&#39;t die?</p><p>I do yoga. I eat well.</p><p>If I wait, does my repenting still count?</p><p>If you mean it, yes.</p><p>Thank you, Father Crowley.</p><p>You have been a tremendous comfort.</p><p>Um... I will let you do your thing.</p><p>Gabrielle.</p><p>We&#39;re all responsible for the choices we make.</p><p>Don&#39;t you want to be a good person?</p><p>What I want is to be happy.</p><p>That&#39;s the answer of a selfish child.</p><p>I know.</p><p>Then I started taking the pills because they gave me energy</p><p>but then I couldn&#39;t sleep at night</p><p>and I was so tired in the daytime and...</p><p>It totally messed me up.</p><p>I love my kids so much.</p><p>I&#39;m so sorry they have me as a mother.</p><p>Lynette, you&#39;re a great mother.</p><p>No, I&#39;m not.</p><p>I can&#39;t do it.</p><p>I&#39;m so tired of feeling like a failure. It&#39;s so humiliating.</p><p>No, it&#39;s not!</p><p>So you got addicted to your kids&#39; ADD Medication.</p><p>It happens.</p><p>You&#39;ve got four kids. That&#39;s a lot of stress</p><p>and you just need some help.</p><p>That&#39;s what&#39;s so humiliating.</p><p>Other moms don&#39;t need help.</p><p>Other moms make it look so easy.</p><p>All I do is complain.</p><p>That&#39;s just not true!</p><p>When Julie was a baby,</p><p>I was out of my mind almost every day.</p><p>I got so upset when Andrew and Danielle were little,</p><p>I used their nap times to cry.</p><p>Why didn&#39;t you ever tell me this?</p><p>Oh, baby. Nobody likes to admit that</p><p>they can&#39;t handle the pressure.</p><p>I think it&#39;s just like we think,</p><p>you know, it&#39;s easier to keep it all in.</p><p>Oh, we shouldn&#39;t! We should tell each other this stuff!</p><p>It helps, huh? - Yeah.</p><p>It really does.</p><p>So it was Martha Huber all along.</p><p>Seems so. Edie didn&#39;t move in with Huber</p><p>until after your wife received the note.</p><p>My god, we almost killed an innocent woman.</p><p>Like I said, I don&#39;t do refunds,</p><p>but if you like, I&#39;m willing to pay Mrs. Huber a visit.</p><p>No. Just keep the money.</p><p>This whole thing&#39;s been tearing me up</p><p>the nightmares, the guilt.</p><p>This isn&#39;t what Mary Alice would have wanted.</p><p>What would she have wanted?</p><p>Answers.</p><p>Hello, Mrs. Huber. - Paul.</p><p>Let me help. - That&#39;s not necessary.</p><p>I insist.</p><p>Ants, huh? - Yes.</p><p>I&#39;ve had a little infestation problem.</p><p>I wanted to take care of it before my trip.</p><p>Never had a problem with ants.</p><p>Mary Alice and I had these little black flies once.</p><p>Oh? - She was so funny about it.</p><p>She ran out and bought herself a can of poison something</p><p>to spray them down.</p><p>So she&#39;s taking aim at one on the counter and</p><p>she just stops.</p><p>Puts the can down. Couldn&#39;t do it.</p><p>She told me later it felt too personal.</p><p>Literally couldn&#39;t kill a fly. That&#39;s how gentle she was.</p><p>Then you must have lived with quite a few flies.</p><p>I&#39;m going to have to say good night to you now, Paul.</p><p>What are you doing here? - I want to know why.</p><p>I know you&#39;ve got a lot of questions</p><p>and I also know I don&#39;t want to lose you.</p><p>So ask me anything you want.</p><p>You just told me everything I need to know.</p><p>All right. My idiot husband died</p><p>and left me with a worthless pension.</p><p>I was desperate for money</p><p>And it&#39;s better to take it from a bad person than a good one.</p><p>How was I suppose to know she&#39;d shoot herself.</p><p>She was a good person.</p><p>A good person who leaves her child motherless?</p><p>Read the Bible, Paul.</p><p>Suicide&#39;s a big no-no.</p><p>Don&#39;t you feel any remorse or whatsoever? - Why should I?</p><p>Your wife didn&#39;t kill herself because I wrote a note.</p><p>She killed herself because of</p><p>what she did to that poor baby.</p><p>But rest assured I&#39;m praying for Mary Alice.</p><p>After what she did, she&#39;ll need all of our prayers.</p><p>There is a widely-read book that</p><p>tells us everyone is a sinner.</p><p>Of course, not everyone feels guilt</p><p>over the bad things they do.</p><p>In contrast, there are those who assume</p><p>more than their share of the blame.</p><p>There are others who soothe their consciences</p><p>with small acts of kindness.</p><p>Or by telling themselves their sins were justified.</p><p>Finally, there are the ones who</p><p>simply vow to do better next time,</p><p>and pray for forgiveness.</p><p>Sometimes, their prayers are answered.</p><h2 id="dh-se01-e09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dh-se01-e09" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DH SE01 E09</h2><p>Previously on Desperate Housewives</p><p>One was careless...</p><p>You put a woman into a coma.</p><p>Surely, that arouses some emotion. - Well, it doesn&#39;t.</p><p>You and I are finished.</p><p>One said goodbye.</p><p>I&#39;m tired of feeling like a failure.</p><p>One almost lost it.</p><p>Your wife didn&#39;t kill herself because of my note,</p><p>she killed herself because of what she did to that poor baby.</p><p>And one got exactly what she deserved.</p><p>Gabrielle was waiting for her next great idea.</p><p>Her first great idea came when she was 15,</p><p>after her stepfather paid her a late-night visit.</p><p>She bought a bus ticket to New York</p><p>the very next day.</p><p>Her next occurred five years later,</p><p>when she decided to seduce</p><p>a famous fashion photographer.</p><p>One week later she began her career</p><p>as a runway model,</p><p>which soon led to her next great idea,</p><p>her decision to marry Carlos Solis.</p><p>Before she knew it,</p><p>she had jumped off the runway and moved to the suburbs.</p><p>Her most recent great idea was born</p><p>out of her boredom with her new life.</p><p>That&#39;s how she came to</p><p>start an affair with her teenage gardener,</p><p>which was cut short by a tragic accident.</p><p>So, once again, Gabrielle was</p><p>in need of a great idea.</p><p>Mrs. Solis, I know you&#39;re worried,</p><p>but it&#39;s gonna take time.</p><p>Hm? What is?</p><p>You look sad.</p><p>I assumed you were thinking about your mother-in-law.</p><p>Oh, no. - So, uh, what were you thinking about?</p><p>My life.</p><p>It hasn&#39;t turned out like I thought it would.</p><p>Oh, honey. - Oh, no. I know I shouldn&#39;t complain.</p><p>It&#39;s just there&#39;s something missing</p><p>and I don&#39;t know what it is.</p><p>Do you ever feel that way? - No.</p><p>When I go home at night, I sleep like a baby.</p><p>&#39;Cause I know I did something</p><p>that day that helped people.</p><p>That must be a nice feeling. - Hm. It is.</p><p>There&#39;s times I wish I didn&#39;t have to work so hard.</p><p>We got a nursing shortage and they cut our budget.</p><p>Attention, all available personnel.</p><p>Code blue, stat, room 214.</p><p>Excuse me. - All available personnel.</p><p>Code blue, stat, room 214.</p><p>Damned! Get a doctor in here. I don&#39;t have an airway.</p><p>No time. I have to intubate.</p><p>Mr. Getz. Mr. Getz, listen.</p><p>You&#39;re not dying on me, ok?</p><p>This tube is to help you breathe.</p><p>I need you to be brave now.</p><p>It was then that Gabrielle got her next great idea.</p><p>She decided to throw the first annual</p><p>Sacred Heart charity fashion show</p><p>to raise money for more nursing staff.</p><p>Gaby, I can&#39;t do it.</p><p>I cannot walk down a runway in one of these dresses.</p><p>They all make me look so fat.</p><p>Please get someone to take my place.</p><p>Listen, Betty! Ok? You&#39;re not quitting on me now.</p><p>We&#39;ll find you a gown that&#39;s black</p><p>and slimming and you&#39;ll look great.</p><p>I need you to be brave now. - Ok.</p><p>And that night when she went to bed,</p><p>Gabrielle slept like a baby.</p><p>Desperate Housewives S01E09</p><p>News of the fashion show</p><p>spread quickly on Wisteria Lane.</p><p>Though the event was for charity,</p><p>Gabrielle soon discovered</p><p>when it came to the latest fashions,</p><p>women are seldom charitable.</p><p>No one knew this better than Edie Britt.</p><p>She understood that</p><p>treachery never goes out of style.</p><p>Susan. - Give me the dress.</p><p>I gave it a shot.</p><p>Hi, Helen. How&#39;s the dress fitting?</p><p>Great. Maybe it could be taken out</p><p>in the shoulder a little.</p><p>Sure. No problem.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>You know, Gabrielle, I never thanked you properly.</p><p>For what? - For what you did for my son.</p><p>It was so nice of you to hire John as your gardener.</p><p>Believe me, it&#39;s been my pleasure.</p><p>How&#39;s he doing? - Good, good.</p><p>I hear he&#39;s dating Danielle Van de Kamp.</p><p>For now.</p><p>It&#39;s just a matter of time before they break up for good.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong?</p><p>She just seems to want much more</p><p>of a relationship than he does.</p><p>You remember what it was like dating teenage boys.</p><p>Vaguely. - Thank you.</p><p>No, you tell Tanaka that if he doesn&#39;t call me</p><p>I&#39;m gonna go down to his office,</p><p>find him and kick his ass!</p><p>Ladies.</p><p>Trouble at work? - I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the problem.</p><p>He&#39;s making money left and right.</p><p>I just wish he&#39;d relax.</p><p>Crap, crap, crap!</p><p>I&#39;m telling you, all of the good dresses are taken.</p><p>Now, what the hell am I supposed to wear?</p><p>Well, Mrs. Huber never showed up.</p><p>Why don&#39;t you wear this one?</p><p>This is an old-lady dress.</p><p>You won&#39;t even be able to see my body.</p><p>That is so like you, Edie.</p><p>You&#39;re always thinking of others.</p><p>So why isn&#39;t Mrs. Huber here?</p><p>Last I heard, she went to visit her sister.</p><p>I just can&#39;t believe that</p><p>Martha would agree to wear this.</p><p>She always says she&#39;d never be caught dead in black.</p><p>Sadly for Mrs. Huber, this was no longer the case.</p><p>Hey, mom.</p><p>Julie, you got a letter from Zach.</p><p>Isn&#39;t that weird, him writing you? - Yeah.</p><p>Well, open. Open, open.</p><p>He could have said something about Dana.</p><p>I&#39;ll read it later.</p><p>Later? What&#39;s wrong with now?</p><p>I&#39;ve got tons of homework, mom.</p><p>Julie, what&#39;s going on?</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first letter from Zach.</p><p>We&#39;ve been writing each other the last couple of weeks.</p><p>Are you mad?</p><p>No. Just when I was your age,</p><p>my pen pal lived on a farm in Ohio,</p><p>not in a mental institution.</p><p>You know, that letter is one notch above prison mail.</p><p>Zach&#39;s not crazy.</p><p>He&#39;s just upset over his mom,</p><p>and his dad doesn&#39;t even seem to care.</p><p>He just... needs a friend.</p><p>I&#39;ve packed the diapers,</p><p>I&#39;m getting the juice boxes and carrot sticks...</p><p>Sunscreen? - Got it.</p><p>I go pick up the boys, we hit the park,</p><p>and that should give you a good couple of hours.</p><p>Enjoy the vacation.</p><p>What?</p><p>While you&#39;re gone, I&#39;ll be paying bills</p><p>and sorting laundry and cooking dinner.</p><p>So what part of that sounds like a vacation?</p><p>Ok, right. We&#39;ll pick up dinner.</p><p>You just take a hot bath, relax, recharge.</p><p>Ok, I get it.</p><p>It&#39;s gonna take more than a hot bath to recharge.</p><p>But don&#39;t forget, I&#39;m here all week.</p><p>Then what?</p><p>And then we go back to normal?</p><p>Tom, our last version of normal</p><p>had me popping pills.</p><p>Normal is a bad, bad plan.</p><p>We&#39;ll put our heads together</p><p>and come up with a solution.</p><p>I think we need to hire a nanny full time.</p><p>God, it&#39;s just such a big commitment. - I know.</p><p>And I know we can&#39;t afford it.</p><p>And I know everything that&#39;s happened is my fault,</p><p>but if I don&#39;t get some help,</p><p>there&#39;s an excellent chance I will lose my mind.</p><p>Ok. Well, then, we have to make it work.</p><p>Next up</p><p>200-meter frestyle.</p><p>It&#39;s just not right. - What?</p><p>A woman is in a coma because of Andrew,</p><p>and there he is, happy as a clam.</p><p>We grounded him, took away the TV in his room.</p><p>How many more ways you wanna punish him?</p><p>Swimmers, take your marks.</p><p>I think we should make him quit the swim team.</p><p>Bree, this is the one thing</p><p>in his life that he&#39;s passionate about.</p><p>Maybe if we take it away from him,</p><p>and he&#39;ll start to understand what he did.</p><p>He has not shown an ounce of remorse since the accident.</p><p>Of course he feels bad. He&#39;s just keeping up a facade.</p><p>Well, he&#39;s doing a fabulous job.</p><p>If we take him off the team,</p><p>He&#39;ll lose his shot at a scholarship</p><p>and he&#39;s never gonna forgive us.</p><p>Well, if it ensures he grows up with some trace of humanity,</p><p>that&#39;s a risk I am willing to take.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m not.</p><p>That because you just don&#39;t love him as much as I do.</p><p>Isn&#39;t that nice?</p><p>It&#39;s a fact. I&#39;m his mother.</p><p>He lived inside of me.</p><p>He hung out in your womb back in the &#39;80s.</p><p>Since than I have grown to love him as much as you.</p><p>What just happened?</p><p>That kid you both love so much, just won the race.</p><p>That&#39;s what she tells me, anyway.</p><p>John.</p><p>My mom said you needed volunteers, so I volunteered.</p><p>Finally got the charity bug?</p><p>You sound surprised.</p><p>No, not really. You were always a giver.</p><p>Would you knock it off? My mom&#39;s right over there.</p><p>Have a seat.</p><p>You can start by helping us alphabetize the donation cards.</p><p>So, word on the street is you and Danielle might break up.</p><p>Maybe. I don&#39;t know.</p><p>Is that because of me?</p><p>Not everything is about you.</p><p>Would you stop that? - Have you been thinking about me?</p><p>No. - Really?</p><p>Could have fooled me.</p><p>Hey. Do you need any help? - Please. Just pull up a chair.</p><p>Oh, gosh. - That&#39;s ok. I got it.</p><p>Susan, hi. Do you want to help with the seating cards?</p><p>Sure, do you want to tell me why you</p><p>had your foot in John Rowland&#39;s crotch yesterday?</p><p>Oh, that. He was helping me adjust the seam in my stocking,</p><p>and from your angle it must have looked a little weird.</p><p>You&#39;re sleeping with him, aren&#39;t you?</p><p>Ok, yes, but you have to promise not to tell anybody.</p><p>Gabrielle, he&#39;s in high school,</p><p>and... it&#39;s illegal and you&#39;re married.</p><p>If Carlos found out, this would kill him.</p><p>It&#39;s just sex. It&#39;s totally harmless.</p><p>How can you call something like this harmless</p><p>after everything you know about I went through with Karl?</p><p>This isn&#39;t about you. - Yes, it is.</p><p>It&#39;s about me and about every other person who was</p><p>screwed over by somebody they loved.</p><p>When Karl ran off with Brandi</p><p>you saw what a basket case I was.</p><p>I was crying,</p><p>I was tearing up his clothes.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t get out of bed all day.</p><p>You were there.</p><p>How could you do the same?</p><p>How can you compare me to Karl? That&#39;s not fair.</p><p>You have no idea about my life.</p><p>Why don&#39;t you enlighten me.</p><p>You&#39;re beautiful, you have money than you can spend</p><p>and you have a husband who adores you.</p><p>No, he doesn&#39;t adore me. He adores having me.</p><p>That&#39;s a rationalization and you know it.</p><p>I&#39;ll see you at the show.</p><p>Ok, honey, in you go. Hey, there.</p><p>How many nannies did you interview? - Ten. Ten!</p><p>Each one more incompetent than the last.</p><p>One asked me... There you go...</p><p>If she was expected to change diapers.</p><p>Good nannies are so hard to find.</p><p>That&#39;s why I hoped to take advantage of your expertise.</p><p>Oh, lord. What do you want me to do?</p><p>All your rich friends have nannies, a-list nannies.</p><p>I need to catch one without their bosses.</p><p>Why? - So I can poach me one.</p><p>Lynette!</p><p>At my old job we didn&#39;t wait for good people to come to us.</p><p>We went out and raided other companies.</p><p>It&#39;s no different with hiring a nanny.</p><p>I understand that good help is hard to find,</p><p>but stealing a family&#39;s nanny is so unseemly.</p><p>I&#39;m not twisting anyone&#39;s arm. If I make a better offer,</p><p>why shouldn&#39;t a qualified person reap the benefits?</p><p>So, come on, where can I score some high-grade nanny?</p><p>Hey, Mrs. Solis. I have some awesome news.</p><p>I have some not-so-awesome news. You go first.</p><p>I broke it off with Danielle.</p><p>I passed her a note during French class.</p><p>So we can be together.</p><p>John, your timing is impeccable. - What do you mean?</p><p>Susan Mayer saw us last night,</p><p>and she knows everything.</p><p>Since the accident, Bree had started to worry</p><p>her son&#39;s sense of morality was going up in smoke.</p><p>She was right to be concerned.</p><p>Andrew? Can I come in?</p><p>Uh, yeah. Just a sec.</p><p>Hey, what&#39;s up?</p><p>Why are you smiling?</p><p>It&#39;s just a... joke that I heard.</p><p>Oh. What was it about? - Well, it&#39;s kind of dirty, mom.</p><p>Charming. What I was wondering is</p><p>if you&#39;ve bothered to spend any time reflecting on</p><p>the reasons that you&#39;ve been grounded</p><p>and the pain you&#39;ve caused the Solis family.</p><p>Yeah. I totally get how my actions</p><p>have affected, like, everything else.</p><p>Really?</p><p>I mean, you know, like, when I do something like I did,</p><p>then you gotta do something like you did,</p><p>which is, you know, it&#39;s cool,</p><p>Because... Then everything just kind of balances itself out</p><p>and... and goes all smooth again.</p><p>You know? - No, I don&#39;t.</p><p>What&#39;s that smell?</p><p>Have you been smoking marijuana?</p><p>No, of course not. - You are strung out!</p><p>No! no, no, no, mom. - Excuse me.</p><p>What&#39;s that? - The container you&#39;ll urinate into.</p><p>Come on. - Ow! ow! ow, that hurts!</p><p>Dr. Sicher, what are you doing here?</p><p>Mr. Young, I didn&#39;t want to upset you</p><p>by telling you over the phone.</p><p>What is it? - Zach is missing from Silvercrest.</p><p>It happened yesterday evening,</p><p>we think during the shift change.</p><p>I know this is difficult to hear. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>Yeah, well, uh, it&#39;s just been one of those days.</p><p>I still don&#39;t get why you&#39;re not with Danielle any more.</p><p>She looked so slutty at Ray&#39;s party.</p><p>She&#39;s not my type, I guess.</p><p>You still hung up on your mysterious married lady?</p><p>What is it with her? Besides the obvious, of course.</p><p>We talk about real stuff.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t treat me like some lame yard boy.</p><p>But you are a lame yard boy.</p><p>It&#39;s all messed up now anyway.</p><p>Her friend found out about us.</p><p>If it gets out, her husband&#39;s gonna kill me.</p><p>On the upside,</p><p>your social status at school is going to explode</p><p>when people find out you&#39;re doing a hot housewife.</p><p>Shut up, dude.</p><p>Please explain to me how he could just walk out.</p><p>With the money I pay, you can afford a padlock.</p><p>With all due respect, we are not a high-security facility,</p><p>and you restrict our ability to treat Zach.</p><p>What the hell does that mean?</p><p>You insist we medicate him without psychotherapy,</p><p>that is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>Zach is a troubled young man,</p><p>and he&#39;s getting progressively worse.</p><p>Hungry?</p><p>I&#39;m starving.</p><p>Bree had given Lynette the low-down on Valley View Park.</p><p>It was a gathering place for upscale nannies</p><p>and their young charges.</p><p>It was Lynette&#39;s first time there,</p><p>and she was determined not to go home alone.</p><p>Of course, Lynette had high standards,</p><p>so making a connection...</p><p>...wasn&#39;t easy.</p><p>Still, she was desperate to find that special someone.</p><p>And that&#39;s exactly who she found.</p><p>Ok. All right.</p><p>Here&#39;s one for you, and one for Amy.</p><p>All right, have fun,</p><p>and I&#39;ll be right here if you need me, ok?</p><p>From the moment she saw her...</p><p>Is this seat taken? - No, go ahead.</p><p>...Lynette knew she had to have her.</p><p>You are wonderful with those children.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>I&#39;m Lynette. - Claire.</p><p>Claire? I always loved that name.</p><p>So, Claire...</p><p>Do you come here often?</p><p>What&#39;s this? - Your son&#39;s urine.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna need a moment.</p><p>I think Andrew has been smoking marijuana.</p><p>So I want you to take this and get it tested right away.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because I want to pull him from the swim team.</p><p>And I don&#39;t think they will allow it without proof.</p><p>Proof or no proof. You&#39;re not taking him off the team.</p><p>Yes, I am.</p><p>If you try, I&#39;m gonna go to the coach</p><p>and tell him to ignore you.</p><p>We&#39;re not gonna screw up Andrew&#39;s future,</p><p>because he sparked a doobie.</p><p>I mean, come on, we&#39;ve all done it. - Not all of us.</p><p>Rex, I thought you moved back home</p><p>to try straighten Andrew out,</p><p>To teach him the consequences of his actions.</p><p>I don&#39;t understand why are you fighting me on this?</p><p>Because I disagree.</p><p>Because we&#39;re still getting divorced.</p><p>And I don&#39;t have to let you push me around any more.</p><p>I never pushed you around.</p><p>We always made our decisions together.</p><p>No, you always make decisions then tell me I agree.</p><p>18 years of smiling and taking it.</p><p>What a liar I was.</p><p>Thank god you&#39;re out of my life. - Rex...</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Same thing you just did to every memory I have of our marriage.</p><p>You know what? If you were my mom, I&#39;d smoke pot too!</p><p>So your boss made you return her underwear?</p><p>Yeah. After she had already worn them once.</p><p>Couldn&#39;t you have just said no?</p><p>You don&#39;t say no to Alexis... If you want to keep your job.</p><p>She sounds awful.</p><p>What can I do? I love the kids.</p><p>If we had a nanny like you in my house,</p><p>we would treat her like gold.</p><p>Did I mention I have four very lovable kids?</p><p>Really? - Oh, yes.</p><p>Claire! - Oh, no.</p><p>What? - It&#39;s Alexis.</p><p>I don&#39;t want her to get the wrong idea. So you should go.</p><p>Are you gonna be here tomorrow?</p><p>I wanna see you again. - No, I&#39;m busy.</p><p>I just want to talk.</p><p>Lynette, this isn&#39;t right.</p><p>Claire, please.</p><p>All right. I will be at this address until noon tomorrow.</p><p>Now go.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Hi. Where are the kids?</p><p>What are you doing here? - I know you know.</p><p>And you&#39;re probably freaking out,</p><p>so I just wanted to explain.</p><p>What me and Mrs. Solis have, it&#39;s deep, you know?</p><p>We&#39;ve got a future. It&#39;s not just sex.</p><p>Listen to me. There is no future for you and Gabrielle.</p><p>She&#39;s not gonna divorce Carlos and run away with you.</p><p>Why not? - Because he has money, a lot of it.</p><p>I&#39;m not gonna be mowing lawns for ever. I have big plans.</p><p>Just stop talking. John, how old are you?</p><p>Almost 18. - Exactly.</p><p>You are not mature enough</p><p>to have a realistic perspective on this relationship.</p><p>You would be much happier with a girl your own age.</p><p>She&#39;s the one I want.</p><p>You know, I really love her.</p><p>Please welcome Mrs. Arlene Nord.</p><p>We have Arlene and Norris to thank</p><p>for all our folding chairs.</p><p>So, please remember, for all your folding chair needs</p><p>...Rent Nords.</p><p>Next up, we have Mrs. Betty Nolan!</p><p>Thank god Tom could fill in in the last minute.</p><p>Why did Carlos have to back out?</p><p>Some work emergency. He wouldn&#39;t talk about it.</p><p>Sometimes I could just kill him.</p><p>Oh, look on the bright side. Tom&#39;s having the time of his life.</p><p>Hands off, fellas. She&#39;s all mine.</p><p>I guess he does sort of have a dorky charm.</p><p>Ok, Bree, you&#39;re up first, followed by Lynette,</p><p>and then Edie. Edie?</p><p>Where&#39;s Edie Britt? - Over here.</p><p>Edie, what did you do to that dress?</p><p>Well, I made it audience friendly.</p><p>Can you tell I&#39;m not wearing underwear?</p><p>Yes. - Good.</p><p>Sorry I&#39;m late.</p><p>You should never take this dress off for your entire life.</p><p>Really? I look ok?</p><p>Oh, Susan, you look so gorgeous.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t she, Edie? - Ah... It&#39;s a bit much.</p><p>Gabrielle. You have to change the line-up.</p><p>Susan has to go last.</p><p>Nothing is gonna top this.</p><p>Oh, no. Isn&#39;t Helen Rowland going last?</p><p>She never showed up. Somebody gonna take this place.</p><p>I think that&#39;s a great idea. Ok, let&#39;s go.</p><p>You really do look fantastic.</p><p>Next up, we have Mrs. Bree Van de Kamp</p><p>in a pink party dress</p><p>with laser cut, full skirt and silk belt.</p><p>Here is another exquisite ball gown by Halston,</p><p>modeled by the devastatingly sexy Lynette Scavo.</p><p>Notice the fine detail, the clean lines.</p><p>The dresser is nice, too.</p><p>Next up, please welcome Edie...</p><p>...Britt.</p><p>Edie Britt!</p><p>Please tell Gabrielle I&#39;m sorry I backed out of the show.</p><p>I&#39;m just not in a very festive mood right now.</p><p>Helen! Helen, you&#39;re here.</p><p>Did they tell you about the change in line-up?</p><p>I&#39;m gonna go last. If that&#39;s ok.</p><p>There&#39;s a special place in hell for people like you.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. It wasn&#39;t my decision.</p><p>You&#39;re an adult. Take some responsibility!</p><p>What is wrong with you?</p><p>She is wearing a dignified classic,</p><p>perfect for a Sunday tea or christening.</p><p>For god&#39;s sake, Helen, this is for charity!</p><p>Edie Britt, everyone!</p><p>Keep your hands off my son! - What?</p><p>And finally, to cap off our evening...</p><p>Come on, you&#39;re up.</p><p>...Please welcome the radiant Susan Mayer.</p><p>Tom, say something!</p><p>A vision in white silk...</p><p>chiffon with gold, hand-beaded French lace</p><p>and lavender marabou.</p><p>Susan Mayer!</p><p>She&#39;s never looked better.</p><p>Susan, I feel awful about what happened.</p><p>Susan, talk to me.</p><p>Ok, you want me to talk? You&#39;re gonna find Helen Rowland</p><p>and you gonna tell her the truth</p><p>before everyone in the neighbour thinks</p><p>I&#39;m the one sleeping with an underage boy.</p><p>I can&#39;t do that. - Why not?</p><p>Because she will tell Carlos and he will divorce me?</p><p>So what?</p><p>You obviously don&#39;t love him.</p><p>I do love him. I do. It&#39;s just... complicated.</p><p>You know, there&#39;s gotta be another way to fix this.</p><p>God, you are so weak.</p><p>Susan, don&#39;t be like this.</p><p>What did you expect? A hug?</p><p>Hey... - Shh! Alexis is still here.</p><p>She was supposed to go to Pilates,</p><p>but she got her period. You gonna go.</p><p>Give me a second.</p><p>No. She saw you at the park.</p><p>She knows what you&#39;re trying to do.</p><p>You&#39;re not the first who approach me.</p><p>Claire!</p><p>How can you stay here after the way she treats you?</p><p>She can be tough, but it comes with the territory.</p><p>I would never treat you that way.</p><p>Claire what did you do with the aspirin?</p><p>I will give you a 20 per cent bump</p><p>on what she&#39;s paying, you plus overtime.</p><p>Dammit, Claire! Where the hell are you?</p><p>I don&#39;t take orders from your friends</p><p>I&#39;m not a telephone answering service</p><p>and I don&#39;t do laundry.</p><p>Dishes? - Only the kids&#39;.</p><p>How fast can you pack?</p><p>I got a nanny!</p><p>Where are you gonna go? - I don&#39;t know.</p><p>But I can&#39;t go home.</p><p>Are you afraid of your dad? - No. It&#39;s not him.</p><p>It&#39;s... It&#39;s me.</p><p>My life is really messed up. It&#39;s bad.</p><p>What&#39;s bad? You can tell me. - No, I can&#39;t!</p><p>It&#39;s better that you don&#39;t know.</p><p>I already know a little.</p><p>Hi, Danielle. How was school? - It was ok.</p><p>Good. Where does Andrew keep his marijuana?</p><p>Bree had resorted to extreme measures to save her son&#39;s soul.</p><p>As she rummaged through Andrew&#39;s private possessions,</p><p>it occurred to her that sometimes a little betrayal...</p><p>is good for the soul.</p><p>I was really young, like four.</p><p>I heard my mom and my dad yelling.</p><p>I heard &#39;em yell my name... and hers.</p><p>Dana? - Mm-hm.</p><p>So... I went down to the room and I saw them cleaning it up.</p><p>Cleaning what up?</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Was it Dana&#39;s?</p><p>I think so.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t remember this for the longest time,</p><p>and then my mom killed herself</p><p>and I started having these dreams.</p><p>I don&#39;t even see Dana. I just... I see the blood</p><p>and my mom picking me up and putting me on my bed</p><p>whispering that it&#39;s not my fault.</p><p>And after that, every time I&#39;d say her name,</p><p>they&#39;d get upset.</p><p>So I wasn&#39;t even allowed to say it any more.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure I understand what you&#39;re saying.</p><p>I killed my baby sister.</p><p>Zach, oh, my god.</p><p>And they buried her to protect me.</p><p>Helen, do you have a minute? - Oh, Gabrielle.</p><p>I didn&#39;t tell you how sorry I was about</p><p>what happened to the fundraise.</p><p>I didn&#39;t intend to cause a scene.</p><p>No, it&#39;s okay. People didn&#39;t even notice.</p><p>This is a little awkward.</p><p>I know you&#39;re friends with Susan Mayer.</p><p>But let&#39;s just say I had my reasons.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t Susan.</p><p>It was me.</p><p>What?</p><p>I&#39;m the one who was sleeping with your son.</p><p>I&#39;m so sorry.</p><p>For how long?</p><p>Almost a year. But it&#39;s over now.</p><p>So when it started,</p><p>he was... 16?</p><p>I think.</p><p>But, Helen, you have to believe me, it&#39;s over now.</p><p>No, you&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s not even close to being over.</p><p>Dude, coach wants to see you. - Really?</p><p>Hey, I bet it&#39;s about my scholarship.</p><p>Hello?</p><p>Yes, this is she.</p><p>Marijuana in his locker? Oh, I&#39;m just horrified.</p><p>There must be some sort of terrible mistake.</p><p>Um, yeah, ok. Well, I will be right down.</p><p>Elsewhere, another darker secret was</p><p>the object of an investigation.</p><p>Mr. Linder? Mr. Linder?</p><p>Detective Beckerman.</p><p>This is detective Burnett.</p><p>We were hoping for a minute of your time.</p><p>If you know anything about Zach&#39;s whereabouts,</p><p>you need to tell me now.</p><p>Honey, what&#39;s going on?</p><p>Zach&#39;s gone from Silvercrest.</p><p>They found letters in his room from Julie.</p><p>They were writing to each other.</p><p>I need to see those letters.</p><p>Mom... They&#39;re private.</p><p>My son is missing.</p><p>Julie, in the letters, did zach say</p><p>anything about running away?</p><p>No.</p><p>There&#39;s your answer. - Susan...</p><p>If we hear anything, I will let you know right away.</p><p>I understand how worried you must be.</p><p>Obviously you don&#39;t.</p><p>Paul, my daughter doesn&#39;t lie.</p><p>This was a very popular design.</p><p>I must have sold</p><p>several hundred of these just like it, ten years back.</p><p>Do you keep any documentation?</p><p>I have a list of customers&#39; names on the file.</p><p>Somewhere. It&#39;s been a while.</p><p>We&#39;ll need a copy of that list.</p><p>Oh, sure. Wow, this chest looks like it&#39;s been through hell.</p><p>We pulled it out of Rockwater lake,</p><p>you could say by way of hell, considering.</p><p>Was there anything in the chest?</p><p>It had a body inside. Adult female.</p><p>Yeah, but how do you fit a body into a chest that size?</p><p>It was chopped up.</p><p>Of all the stupid, boneheaded decisions.</p><p>What were you thinking?</p><p>I was set up. The coach got an anonymous phone call.</p><p>Andrew, what does it matter? The pot was there.</p><p>I was holding it for a friend. - You know...</p><p>I can&#39;t decide which is more humiliating,</p><p>the fact that my son got caught with pot in his locker</p><p>or that he can&#39;t even come up with</p><p>a decent enough lie to explain it.</p><p>Gabrielle believed there was a excellent chance</p><p>Helen Rowland would inform Carlos of</p><p>his wife&#39;s extramarital activities.</p><p>Gabrielle knew she had to come clean.</p><p>Carlos? - Yeah?</p><p>But coming clean...</p><p>I, uh...</p><p>...Was not one of Gabrielle&#39;s specialties.</p><p>I&#39;m going to bed. - Thanks for the newsflash.</p><p>She turned me in!</p><p>Carlos. Carlos, I&#39;m so sorry.</p><p>I am so sorry. - Sorry for what?</p><p>Just know that whatever happens, I love you very, very much.</p><p>F.B.I. Open the door. - Oh, my god.</p><p>F.B.I.

Don&#39;t go.</p><p>I won&#39;t tell her.</p><p>I swear I&#39;ll be out of here soon.</p><p>I&#39;ll think of something, ok?</p><p>Hello. - Why are you up?</p><p>I could ask you the same question.</p><p>I&#39;m going to bed.</p><p>I didn&#39;t ask you to wait up for me.</p><p>Remember, I&#39;m here as our children&#39;s father,</p><p>not your husband.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Were you with a woman?</p><p>Did you tell her that you have a wife</p><p>or does that hinder your pick-up style?</p><p>All right, even if I was seeing someone,</p><p>I have every right to.</p><p>Exploring options is the whole point of being separated.</p><p>Options! I&#39;m not a mutual fund, Rex.</p><p>Oh, that&#39;s not...</p><p>Bree, you should get out there,</p><p>try and meet someone.</p><p>Meet someone? I&#39;m raising your children.</p><p>I am just trying to move on with my life.</p><p>It is nothing to be ashamed of. - Oh, ok.</p><p>Let me tell you what then, why don&#39;t you just call up</p><p>your mystery woman and invite her over?</p><p>I&#39;ll pull out the sofa bed</p><p>and you can take her right there.</p><p>Andrew! Danielle!</p><p>Daddy&#39;s gonna fornicate for us!</p><p>Just keep your voice down.</p><p>Why? Are you feeling ashamed?</p><p>The next morning started with a banging.</p><p>No one knew where Martha Huber was,</p><p>and Edie Britt was starting to worry.</p><p>Edie didn&#39;t like worrying.</p><p>She felt it gave her wrinkles.</p><p>So, out of concern for her face, and Mrs. Huber,</p><p>Edie decided to find out what was going on.</p><p>Yao Lin, listen to me.</p><p>It&#39;s very important that we find Carlos&#39;s passport.</p><p>I already looked through his office.</p><p>I need you to search the bedroom.</p><p>What?</p><p>With Mr. Solis in jail, how you gonna pay me?</p><p>I have children.</p><p>Yao Lin, your kids are in their twenties.</p><p>But if it&#39;ll make you shut up...</p><p>Here. Three weeks in advance.</p><p>If you don&#39;t mind,</p><p>can I call your bank?</p><p>Yao Lin, don&#39;t be stupid.</p><p>People don&#39;t become poor overnight.</p><p>That&#39;s my car. Oh, my god.</p><p>Hey! Hey! What are you doing?</p><p>Where are you taking my car?</p><p>The government&#39;s impounding it. Here&#39;s your receipt</p><p>Call that number if you have any questions.</p><p>Oh, my god</p><p>You call this a paint job?</p><p>I don&#39;t want to see it again till it&#39;s perfect!</p><p>I wonder what&#39;s going on over there.</p><p>Claire did ok with kids yesterday.</p><p>But that could have been beginner&#39;s luck.</p><p>Do you think I should call? I should call</p><p>Lynette, for the first time in years you finally have some free time,</p><p>and you&#39;re wasting it obsessing about the kids.</p><p>It&#39;s just.. I don&#39;t know this woman. I mean not really.</p><p>So she has a degree in sociology,</p><p>big deal. Who doesn&#39;t?</p><p>My boys are a lot to handle. What if she&#39;s not up to it?</p><p>If you really have that many doubts,</p><p>you should go buy a hidden camera.</p><p>What, a nanny-cam?</p><p>Yeah. People do terrible things</p><p>when they think no one&#39;s watching them.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I don&#39;t really think that I could videotape Claire.</p><p>It would be a breach of trust.</p><p>Trust is overrated.</p><p>So... How are things with you and Rex?</p><p>Fine. Why do you ask?</p><p>I&#39;m just curious. He moves out, moves back in.</p><p>Is he back for good?</p><p>The situation is...fluid.</p><p>Dialogue: 0,0:12:55.91,0:12:58.60,Default,,0000,0000,0000,,我也不知道他到底作何打算\\NI’m not certain what his plans are yet.</p><p>So if you&#39;re not sure he&#39;s back for good,</p><p>why are you ironing his shirts?</p><p>Because I have faith that he&#39;ll come back</p><p>and that he&#39;ll do the right thing.</p><p>That&#39;s good. It&#39;s good to have faith in people.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>But I&#39;d still buy that camera.</p><p>Hello? - Mike? My oven&#39;s out.</p><p>Come over and help me find my pilot light.</p><p>*lay all my trouble down</p><p>*here I am, baby come and take me</p><p>*here I am, baby won&#39;t you come and take me?</p><p>*take me by the hand</p><p>*show me here I am, baby...</p><p>Oh, candles. Candles</p><p>*here I am, baby come and take me</p><p>*here I am, baby come and take me...</p><p>*take me by the hand</p><p>Mike, is that you?</p><p>I&#39;m up here!</p><p>Mike?</p><p>Oh, my god! oh, god. - What the hell?</p><p>I&#39;m so sorry. I thought someone was in the house.</p><p>So you took your clothes off?</p><p>No, my clothes already off, I was going to seduce you.</p><p>Didn&#39;t really work.</p><p>Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Are you ok?</p><p>Well...</p><p>Please don&#39;t be mad.</p><p>Hey, there.</p><p>Zach? What are you doing here?</p><p>Later that day, while Claire was out</p><p>getting the boys wired on ice cream,</p><p>Lynette did some wiring on her own.</p><p>You can&#39;t do this.</p><p>You can&#39;t send Zach back.</p><p>Julie, what else can I do? He can&#39;t stay here.</p><p>His father sent him to a psycho ward.</p><p>Actually, they call it a rehabilitation center.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>Paul is his father.</p><p>He has a right to know his son&#39;s ok.</p><p>If he finds out you&#39;re hiding him,</p><p>you could get in a lot of trouble.</p><p>He&#39;s right. Sorry, guys.</p><p>Mom, please don&#39;t do this.</p><p>If you knew what Zach had been through...</p><p>Julie. Julie, it&#39;s ok. I&#39;ll be fine.</p><p>I&#39;ll take him back over so you two can...</p><p>Listen, if Paul sees Zach and freaks out...</p><p>I&#39;ll bring him right back. - Thank you.</p><p>Young lady, we need to talk about what you did.</p><p>I really don&#39;t feel like talking to you right now.</p><p>Listen, Zach...</p><p>If things ever get really bad...</p><p>it&#39;s got my cell number on it.</p><p>Give me a call... any time.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Oh, thank god.</p><p>How did you...? - We&#39;ll talk later.</p><p>Remember, any time.</p><p>I heard you moved back home. - Yeah, I had to.</p><p>We had some problems with Andrew.</p><p>I&#39;ll move out eventually.</p><p>Spikes or pearls? - Your choice.</p><p>You know what I think?</p><p>You don&#39;t really want to leave her.</p><p>Don&#39;t psychoanalyze me.</p><p>You&#39;re still in love.</p><p>I never said I wasn&#39;t. - Then why divorce?</p><p>So now you&#39;re rooting for us two crazy kids to work it out?</p><p>You know me. I&#39;m just a romantic at heart.</p><p>Scarves or cuffs?</p><p>Up to you. Even if I could find a way to deal with</p><p>Bree&#39;s obsessive-compulsive thing,</p><p>it&#39;s not the only problem.</p><p>As you know, I have certain needs.</p><p>Boots or stilettos?</p><p>Stilettos, please.</p><p>Why don&#39;t you just tell Bree what you need?</p><p>Tell her what you want.</p><p>Because she&#39;d say no. - So?</p><p>I&#39;ve said no to some things you&#39;ve asked me to do.</p><p>Yeah, that&#39;s different. I don&#39;t care if you reject me.</p><p>Rex, would you trust me on this?</p><p>Sometimes when you love somebody,</p><p>you just gotta make sacrifices for them.</p><p>Love or passion. That&#39;s an awful choice to make.</p><p>Yes, it is.</p><p>I have to warn you, this might hurt a little bit.</p><p>How am I supposed to live without a car?</p><p>Tanaka&#39;s still at large</p><p>and they want Carlos to flip on him.</p><p>So this is their way of playing hardball.</p><p>I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;re not done yet.</p><p>Why? What else could they take from us?</p><p>Pretty much anything.</p><p>It&#39;s all fair game if they even think</p><p>they can trace it to ill-gotten gains.</p><p>No, some of this stuff is mine,</p><p>when I modeled, before I even met Carlos.</p><p>See this? Kosta Boda.</p><p>I bought it when I landed my first cover.</p><p>This... I spent eight hours on a rock in a bikini</p><p>for that painting.</p><p>I understand how you feel. - No, you don&#39;t understand.</p><p>I have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things</p><p>and no one is gonna take them away from me.</p><p>Then I suggest you find yourself a good hiding place.</p><p>They can&#39;t take what they can&#39;t find.</p><p>And if you can scare up that passport too, that would be good.</p><p>Oh. Hi, Gabrielle. - Hi.</p><p>What have you got there? - My china.</p><p>I know how you&#39;ve always loved it.</p><p>And I thought you might wanna borrow it for a while.</p><p>Oh. Well, that&#39;s... very thoughtful of you.</p><p>Say, can I store some</p><p>odds and ends in your garage?</p><p>Sure. Why don&#39;t you come by tomorrow?</p><p>Sooner&#39;s better than later.</p><p>Just like... - Come on now.</p><p>Rex?</p><p>Rex?</p><p>Rex!</p><p>I need an ambulance... Right away.</p><p>Hello?</p><p>Yes, this is she. Yes, he&#39;s my husband.</p><p>Excuse me. I&#39;m here to see Rex Van de Kamp.</p><p>Apparently he had a heart attack. I&#39;m not sure...</p><p>He&#39;s being prepped for surgery right now.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to wait?</p><p>Could I at least poke my head in? I&#39;m his wife.</p><p>You&#39;re his wife? - Yes. Why?</p><p>I was thinking of a different patient.</p><p>Let me get the doctor.</p><p>As Claire prepared for bed,</p><p>she was unaware that somewhere else in the Scavo house</p><p>the day she had just finished was starting all over again.</p><p>Lynette was relieved to see that</p><p>Claire was doing a good job.</p><p>But after further viewing...</p><p>Give me a three-bear hug.</p><p>...It dawned on lynette...</p><p>...Claire might be doing herjob a little too well.</p><p>Here&#39;s the candles I borrowed.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to read, so if you don&#39;t mind.</p><p>I cannot believe, after everything you did,</p><p>you&#39;re mad at me.</p><p>I told Zach that he could trust you</p><p>and you turned him in.</p><p>Well, someone had to be responsible.</p><p>Like it or not, I&#39;ve got a birth certificate</p><p>that says I&#39;m your mother.</p><p>Since when? - What is that supposed to mean?</p><p>Since dad left, if there&#39;s been</p><p>a mother around here, it&#39;s been me.</p><p>Julie!</p><p>Do you remember after the divorce you stayed in bed for a week</p><p>and I had to beg you to eat.</p><p>Yeah, but...</p><p>For weeks I had to clean the house,</p><p>make sure the bills were paid,</p><p>I even had to schedule my own doctor&#39;s appointment once.</p><p>I was in bad shape back then.</p><p>It&#39;s still going on.</p><p>And now that I need some support,</p><p>you decide to play the mom card?</p><p>I had to send Zach back.</p><p>We could have gotten in a lot of trouble.</p><p>Yeah, well now Zach&#39;s the one who&#39;s in trouble.</p><p>You sent him back to a man who hates him.</p><p>As Gabrielle considered</p><p>the vast emptiness of her new surroundings,</p><p>she was surprised to find</p><p>there was only one thing she truly missed...</p><p>... her husband.</p><p>Mrs. Solis. We have a warrant to enter your house</p><p>and repossess any goods we suspect</p><p>may have been obtained... illegally.</p><p>We&#39;re not into clutter.</p><p>All right. Harvey the flying turtle.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t this look fun?</p><p>Where&#39;s Claire? - I gave her the afternoon off.</p><p>Who wants to turn pages? - Is she sick?</p><p>No. She&#39;s fine. I just wanted us all to spend</p><p>the day together, you know, like we used to.</p><p>Here we go. &quot;Once upon a time</p><p>there was a young turtle named Harvey.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Everyday Harvey would tell the other turtles &#39;One day</p><p>I&#39;m going to fly off and cause I&#39;m gonna go see the world.&quot;&#39;</p><p>&quot;The other turtles said</p><p>&#39;turtles can&#39;t fly!&#39;&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s getting good now, huh?</p><p>Well, what&#39;s wrong?</p><p>When Claire reads. She does funny voices.</p><p>Does she, now? Ok.</p><p>&quot;Harvey didn&#39;t like the turtles laughing</p><p>so he told them &#39;I&#39;ll show you!</p><p>One day I will fly higher than the birds.&#39;&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s not funny. - Yeah, well, I&#39;m just warming up.</p><p>&quot;Then Bruno, the big bad turtle, took Harvey</p><p>up on the cliff and threw him over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He proclaimed &#39; we&#39;ll see</p><p>if you can fly! Fly or die! Fly or die!&quot;&#39;</p><p>When&#39;s Claire coming back?</p><p>What happened to your nails?</p><p>Oh, I... I moved all our stuff</p><p>to keep it from the feds.</p><p>It kills me that I&#39;m putting you through this.</p><p>Hands on the table.</p><p>It&#39;s not your fault. You didn&#39;t do anything wrong.</p><p>I&#39;ll take care of everything</p><p>until you&#39;re back to do it yourself.</p><p>And you will be soon.</p><p>I gotta be honest. I didn&#39;t know how you would hold up.</p><p>I knew you were a strong woman,</p><p>but I had no idea.</p><p>You&#39;re a good wife, Gaby. A real partner.</p><p>Oh, Carlos, I love you so much.</p><p>I would give up a houseful of expensive junk</p><p>just to put this behind us and have you home with me.</p><p>That sounds pretty good right now.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna kiss my husband now. - Hands on the table.</p><p>There&#39;s a false panel on the back wall of my closet.</p><p>My passport is there, along with some papers.</p><p>Take the passport to the lawyer and burn the papers.</p><p>Carlos, did you know what Tanaka was doing?</p><p>Just burn the papers.</p><p>Hey, Lynette.</p><p>Did Martha Huber leave a spare key to her house with you?</p><p>No. Where is she, by the way? I haven&#39;t seen her in days.</p><p>You got me. She kicked me out so fast</p><p>that I forgot my laptop,</p><p>And there&#39;s just some stuff on there</p><p>that I don&#39;t want anyone else to see.</p><p>Oh. Well, good luck with that.</p><p>You know, you&#39;re not looking half bad.</p><p>What have you done with our little posse of yours?</p><p>They&#39;re with the new nanny.</p><p>Wow. Your own personal nanny?</p><p>Smell you.</p><p>Trust me, it&#39;s not all it&#39;s cracked up to be.</p><p>Our mothers are smart.</p><p>They didn&#39;t get us nannies or put us in daycare,</p><p>because they knew if they did</p><p>we&#39;d find out there are other women out there who</p><p>were better mothers than they were.</p><p>You know, I had a nanny for a while growing up.</p><p>Mrs. Muntz. - You had a nanny?</p><p>Well, actually, she was more like</p><p>a court-appointed social worker.</p><p>My mom did a little time.</p><p>She had a thing for bourbon and...</p><p>shoplifting.</p><p>Oh. Sorry.</p><p>Muntz was a hard-ass. No mercy.</p><p>In fact, she was such a disciplinarian</p><p>that when my mom made parole,</p><p>I was actually happy to see her.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Yeah. Lesser of two evils.</p><p>Anyway, I gotta find a key.</p><p>See you later. - Bye.</p><p>Thanks for your help with Zach before.</p><p>It&#39;s my pleasure. I hope he comes out of this ok.</p><p>He&#39;s a little squirrelly, but he seems like a good kid.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>So, how&#39;s Julie taking all this?</p><p>Not well. She accused me of not being a good mother.</p><p>No, you&#39;re a great mom.</p><p>Well, she was sort of right.</p><p>After my divorce, I really leaned on her a lot.</p><p>Seems natural.</p><p>And I still kinda do it.</p><p>I just want somebody to talk to about all my adult stuff,</p><p>and she&#39;s right there, and she just acts so mature,</p><p>I forget she&#39;s thirteen.</p><p>Well, the good news is that from now on,</p><p>if you ever want to talk to somebody about grown-up stuff,</p><p>you got me.</p><p>I can&#39;t talk to you about everything.</p><p>What if I want to talk about the big crush I have</p><p>on the plumber that lives across the street?</p><p>Big crush, huh? - Oh, yeah.</p><p>Well, you&#39;d have to tell me more.</p><p>Well... He&#39;s got a smile that&#39;s to die for.</p><p>And don&#39;t get me started on his tattoo.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Oh, Bree.</p><p>What a nice surprise.</p><p>Would you like to come in?</p><p>Well, that depends.</p><p>Are you having an affair with my husband?</p><p>Would you like some more potatoes?</p><p>You already asked me that.</p><p>Sorry. I&#39;m so relieved you&#39;re safe,</p><p>I&#39;m not thinking straight.</p><p>Does that mean you&#39;re not gonna send me back to Silvercrest?</p><p>You&#39;ve gotta understand, your behavior, the violence,</p><p>breaking into the Van de Kamps...</p><p>I just didn&#39;t know what you were going through.</p><p>You could have asked me.</p><p>I&#39;ve been remembering things...</p><p>things from when I was little.</p><p>What kind of things? - Awful things.</p><p>Zach, listen to me.</p><p>Sometimes it&#39;s not good to look back on the past.</p><p>But I can&#39;t help it.</p><p>These images just keep popping into my head.</p><p>You&#39;ve got to find a way to push them back out again.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>More potatoes?</p><p>Yes, please.</p><p>Sure is nice to be back to normal.</p><p>You should know that Rex still loves you... very much.</p><p>He said that? - Yes.</p><p>Then why is he so unhappy?</p><p>He has certain needs,</p><p>and he&#39;s afraid to discuss them with you.</p><p>Needs? Like... sexual needs?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>And have you fulfilled those needs?</p><p>I see.</p><p>You are pretty brazen for a woman who just admitted,</p><p>however tacitly, that she just slept with my husband.</p><p>If I told anyone in this neighbor,</p><p>they would never speak to you again.</p><p>You&#39;re not gonna tell a soul.</p><p>Yeah, you may hate me,</p><p>but you&#39;d hate the humiliation a lot more.</p><p>Oh, I don&#39;t hate you, Maisy. I pity you.</p><p>Hi. - Oh, hey, Lynette.</p><p>You heading out now? - Yep.</p><p>I&#39;ll be home late, so just the usual routine.</p><p>A nap for penny and...</p><p>I know, no sugar after five. I got it.</p><p>You&#39;re the best.</p><p>Oh, one more thing.</p><p>Since the boys are having corndogs for dinner,</p><p>I&#39;d like you to make sure they get a vegetable to go with it.</p><p>Brussels sprouts? - They&#39;re full of iron.</p><p>Make sure they clean their plates.</p><p>Not a problem. I have this trick.</p><p>I cover the veggies with some cheese.</p><p>Ooh. You sly dog.</p><p>That night Lynette settled in to watch her personal pick</p><p>for fell-good movie of the year.</p><p>You need to eat your Brussels sprouts.</p><p>Brussels sprouts? Disgusting! - I don&#39;t want this!</p><p>Hey! Yes, you do! Don&#39;t throw them.</p><p>Hey! Hey, stop it! - I hate Brussels sprouts!</p><p>You guys, stop it!</p><p>Do not throw them at me. Cut it out!</p><p>They operated, huh?</p><p>They sure did.</p><p>How&#39;d it go?</p><p>It went well.</p><p>The surgeon says you&#39;re gonna be as good as new.</p><p>You look like you&#39;ve been crying. - I have.</p><p>I was so afraid you were gonna die.</p><p>There&#39;s so many things I haven&#39;t had a chance to tell you.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry you were so worried. - That&#39;s ok.</p><p>How are you now, Rex?</p><p>Are you strong enough</p><p>to listen to the things I need to tell you?</p><p>Sure, honey.</p><p>I know you still love me.</p><p>Maisy told me.</p><p>She did?</p><p>As of this moment, Rex, I am no longer your wife.</p><p>I am gonna go out and find</p><p>the most vindictive lawyer I can find,</p><p>and together we are going to eviscerate you.</p><p>I am gonna take away your money,</p><p>your family and your dignity.</p><p>Do you hear me? - Bree...</p><p>And I am so thrilled to know that you still love me.</p><p>Because I want what&#39;s about to happen to you...</p><p>...to hurt as much as is humanly possible.</p><p>I&#39;m so glad you didn&#39;t die before</p><p>I got a chance to tell you that.</p><p>Trust is a fragile thing.</p><p>Bye, guys! - Bye, mom!</p><p>Once earned, it affords us tremendous freedom.</p><p>But once trust is lost, it can be impossible to recover.</p><p>Of course, the truth is, we never know who we can trust.</p><p>Those we&#39;re closest to can betray us.</p><p>Police, open up!</p><p>And total strangers can come to our rescue.</p><p>In the end, most people decide to trust only themselves.</p><p>It really is the simplest way</p><p>to keep from getting burned.</p><h2 id="dh-se01-e11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dh-se01-e11" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DH SE01 E11</h2>',6894)],n={},s=(0,o(3744).Z)(n,[["render",function(e,p){return(0,t.wg)(),(0,t.iD)("div",null,a)}]])},3744:(e,p)=>{p.Z=(e,p)=>{const o=e.__vccOpts||e;for(const[e,t]of p)o[e]=t;return o}}}]);
