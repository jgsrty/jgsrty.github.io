Young.</p><p>When you read this morning&#39;s paper,</p><p>you may come across an article about the unusual day I had last week.</p><p>Normally, there&#39;s never anything newsworthy about my life,</p><p>but that all changed last thursday.</p><p>Of course, everything seemed quite normal at first.</p><p>I made breakfast for my family.</p><p>I performed my chores.</p><p>I completed my projects.</p><p>I ran my errands.</p><p>In truth, I spent the day as I spent every other day,</p><p>quietly polishing the routine of my life</p><p>until it gleamed with perfection.</p><p>That&#39;s why it was so astonishing when I decided to go to my hallway closet</p><p>and retrieve a revolver that had never been used.</p><p>My body was discovered by my neighbor,</p><p>Mrs. Martha Huber,</p><p>who&#39;d been startled by a strange popping sound.</p><p>Her curiosity aroused, Mrs. Huber tried to think of a reason</p><p>for dropping in on me unannounced.</p><p>After some initial hesitation,</p><p>she decided to return the blender she</p><p>had borrowed from me six months before.</p><p>It&#39;s my neighbor. I think she&#39;s been shot.</p><p>There&#39;s blood everywhere.</p><p>Yes, you&#39;ve got to send an ambulance.</p><p>You&#39;ve got to send one right now.</p><p>And, for a moment,</p><p>Mrs. Huber stood motionless in her kitchen,</p><p>grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy.</p><p>But only for a moment.</p><p>If there was one thing Mrs. Huber was known for,</p><p>it was her ability to look on the bright side.</p><p>I was laid to rest on a Monday.</p><p>After the funeral, all the residents of Wisteria Lane</p><p>came to pay their respects.</p><p>And, as people do in these situations,</p><p>they brought food.</p><p>Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.</p><p>Lynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken.</p><p>Of course, she didn&#39;t cook much</p><p>while moving up the corporate ladder.</p><p>She didn&#39;t have the time.</p><p>But when her doctor announced she was pregnant,</p><p>her husband Tom had an idea.</p><p>&quot;Why not quit your job?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Kids do better with stay-at-home moms.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It would be so much less stressful.&quot;</p><p>But this was not the case.</p><p>In fact, Lynette&#39;s life had become so hectic</p><p>she was now forced to get her chicken</p><p>from the fast-food restaurant.</p><p>Lynette would&#39;ve appreciated</p><p>the irony if she&#39;d thought about it.</p><p>But she couldn&#39;t. She didn&#39;t have the time.</p><p>Stop it, stop it, stop it. - But, mom.</p><p>No. You are going to behave today.</p><p>I am not going to be humiliated</p><p>in front of the entire neighborhood.</p><p>And, just so you know how seerious I am...</p><p>What&#39;s that?</p><p>Santa&#39;s cell-phone number.</p><p>How did you get that?</p><p>I know someone who knows someone who knows an elf.</p><p>And if any of you acts up,</p><p>so help me, I will call Santa</p><p>and I will tell him you want socks for Christmas.</p><p>Are you willing to risk that?</p><p>Ok. Let&#39;s get this over with.</p><p>Gabrielle Solis who lives down the</p><p>block brought a spicy paella.</p><p>Since her modeling days in New York,</p><p>Gabrielle had developed a taste</p><p>for rich food...</p><p>...and rich men.</p><p>Carlos, who worked in mergers and acquisitions,</p><p>proposed on their third date.</p><p>Gabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes.</p><p>But she soon discovered this happened</p><p>every time Carlos closed a big deal.</p><p>Gabrielle liked her paella piping hot.</p><p>However, her relationship with her</p><p>husband was considerably cooler.</p><p>If you talk to Al Mason at this thing,</p><p>I want you to casually mention</p><p>how much I paid for your necklace.</p><p>Why not pin the receipt to my chest?</p><p>He let me know how much he paid</p><p>for his wife&#39;s convertible.</p><p>Look, just work it into the conversation.</p><p>There&#39;s no way I can just work that in, Carlos.</p><p>Why not? At the Donahue party,</p><p>everyone was talking mutual funds.</p><p>You found a way to mentioned you slept with</p><p>half the Yankee outfield.</p><p>I&#39;m telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation.</p><p>Hey, people are starting to stare.</p><p>Can you keep your voice down, please?</p><p>Absolutely. We wouldn&#39;t want</p><p>them to think we&#39;re not happy.</p><p>Bree Van De Kamp, who lives next door,</p><p>brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch.</p><p>Bree was known for her cooking,</p><p>and for making her own clothes,</p><p>and for doing her own gardening,</p><p>and for re-upholstering her own furniture.</p><p>Yes, Bree&#39;s many talents were known</p><p>throughout the neighborhood.</p><p>Everyone on Wisteria Lane thought of</p><p>Bree as the perfect wife and mother.</p><p>Everyone, that is, except her own family.</p><p>Paul. Zachary.</p><p>Hello, Mrs. Van De Kamp.</p><p>Bree, you shouldn&#39;t have gone to all this trouble.</p><p>It was no trouble at all.</p><p>Now, the basket with the red ribbon</p><p>is filled with desserts for your guests,</p><p>but the one with the blue ribbon</p><p>is just for you and Zachary.</p><p>It&#39;s got rolls, muffins,</p><p>breakfast type things.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Well, the least I could do is make sure</p><p>you boys had a decent meal</p><p>to look forward to in the morning.</p><p>I know you&#39;re out of your minds with grief.</p><p>Yes, we are.</p><p>Of course, I will need the baskets back once you&#39;re done.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Susan Mayer, who lives across the street,</p><p>brought macaroni and cheese.</p><p>Her husband, Karl, always teased her about her macaroni,</p><p>saying it was the only thing she knew how</p><p>to cook and she rarely made it well.</p><p>It was too salty the night she</p><p>and Karl moved into their house.</p><p>It was too watery the night she</p><p>found lipstick on Karl&#39;s shirt.</p><p>She burned it the night Karl told her</p><p>he was leaving her for his secretary.</p><p>A year had passed since the divorce.</p><p>Susan had started to think how nice it</p><p>would be to have a man in her life.</p><p>Even one who would make fun of her cooking.</p><p>Mom, why would someone kill themselves?</p><p>Well, sometimes people are so unhappy,</p><p>they think that&#39;s the only way to solve their problems.</p><p>Mrs. Young always seemed happy. - Yeah.</p><p>Sometimes people pretend to be one way,</p><p>when they&#39;re totally different on the inside.</p><p>Oh, you mean like how dad&#39;s girlfriend always smiling and says</p><p>nice things, but we know she&#39;s a bitch.</p><p>I don&#39;t like that word, Julie.</p><p>But, yeah, that&#39;s a great example.</p><p>You&#39;re welcome.</p><p>What&#39;s going on?</p><p>Sorry I&#39;m late.</p><p>Hi, Susan. - Hey.</p><p>So, what did Karl say when you confronted him?</p><p>You&#39;ll love this. He said...</p><p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t mean anything. It was just sex.&quot;</p><p>Ah, yes, page one of the philanderer&#39;s handbook.</p><p>Yeah, and then he got this zen look on his face,</p><p>and he said, &quot;you know, Susan,</p><p>most men live lives of quiet desperation.&quot;</p><p>Please tell me you punched him.</p><p>No. I said, &quot;Really? And what do most women</p><p>lead lives of noisy fulfillment?&quot;</p><p>Hmm. Good for you.</p><p>I mean, of all people,</p><p>did he have to bang his secretary?</p><p>I had that woman over for brunch.</p><p>It&#39;s like my grandmother always said --</p><p>an erect penis doesn&#39;t have a conscience.</p><p>Even the limp ones aren&#39;t that ethical.</p><p>This is half the reason I joined the NRA.</p><p>Well, when Rex started going to those medical conferences,</p><p>I wanted it in the back of his mind that</p><p>he had a loving wife at home</p><p>with a loaded Smith &amp; Wesson.</p><p>Lynnie, Tom&#39;s always away on business.</p><p>Do you ever worry he might?</p><p>Oh, please, the man&#39;s gotten me pregnant three times in four years.</p><p>I wish he was having sex with someone else.</p><p>So, Susan, is he gonna stop seeing that woman?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, you guys, I just...</p><p>I just don&#39;t know how I&#39;m gonna survive this.</p><p>Listen to me.</p><p>We all have moments of desperation.</p><p>If we can face them head-on, that&#39;s when</p><p>we&#39;d find out how strong we really are.</p><p>Susan.</p><p>Susan.</p><p>I was just saying Paul wants us to go over on friday.</p><p>He needs us to go to Mary Alice&#39;s closet</p><p>and help pack up her things.</p><p>He says he can&#39;t face doing it by himself.</p><p>Sure. That&#39;s fine. - Are you ok?</p><p>Yeah. I&#39;m just so angry.</p><p>If Mary Alice was having problems,</p><p>she should have come to us. She should&#39;ve let us help her.</p><p>What problems could she have had? She was healthy,</p><p>had a great home, a nice family. Her life was...</p><p>Our life.</p><p>No. If Mary Alice was having a crisis,</p><p>we&#39;d have known.</p><p>She lives 50 feet away, for god sakes.</p><p>Gabby, the woman killed herself.</p><p>Something must&#39;ve been going on.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t eat that if I were you. - Why?</p><p>I made it. Trust me.</p><p>Hey, hey, do you have a death wish?</p><p>No, I just refused to believe that anybody</p><p>can screw up macaroni and cheese.</p><p>Oh, my god.</p><p>How did you...? It tastes like</p><p>it&#39;s burnt and undercooked.</p><p>Yeah, I get that a lot. Here you go.</p><p>Thanks. I&#39;m Mike Delfino.</p><p>I just started renting the Sims&#39; house next door.</p><p>Susan Mayer. I live across the street.</p><p>Mrs. Huber told me about you,</p><p>said you illustrate children&#39;s books.</p><p>Yeah, I&#39;m very big with the under-five set.</p><p>What do you do?</p><p>Plumber. So if you ever have a clog...</p><p>...or something.</p><p>Now that everybody&#39;s seen that I brought something,</p><p>I should probably just throw this out.</p><p>Ease up, you little vampire.</p><p>Lynette, I&#39;ve been looking all over for you.</p><p>Are you aware of what your sons are doing?</p><p>Cannonball!</p><p>Stop!</p><p>What are you doing? We are at a wake.</p><p>Oh my god. You said we could go in the pool.</p><p>I said you could go by the pool.</p><p>Do you have your swimsuits on?</p><p>Yeah, we put &#39;em on ourselves before we left.</p><p>You three planned this? All right. That&#39;s it. Get out.</p><p>No. - No?</p><p>I am your mother. You have to do what I say. Come on.</p><p>We want to swim and you can&#39;t stop us!</p><p>Here.</p><p>No! - Get out.</p><p>Think I won&#39;t get in this pool and just grab you? Get out!</p><p>Get over here.</p><p>Get over here.</p><p>All right, give me your arm.</p><p>You...</p><p>That&#39;s right. Get over here.</p><p>Go, go, go, go, go. Move it.</p><p>Out. Get out.</p><p>Paul, we have to leave now.</p><p>Once again, I am so sorry for your loss.</p><p>Go.</p><p>Lynette shouldn&#39;t have been so concerned about my husband.</p><p>He had other things on his mind. Things below the surface.</p><p>The morning after my funeral, my friends</p><p>and neighbors quietly went back</p><p>to their busy, busy lives.</p><p>While some did their cooking...</p><p>...And some did their cleaning...</p><p>...And some did their yoga...</p><p>...Others...</p><p>...did their &quot;homework&quot;.</p><p>Hi...</p><p>I&#39;m Julie. I kicked my soccer ball into your backyard.</p><p>Oh, ok. Well, let&#39;s go round and get it.</p><p>Stay</p><p>His wife died a year ago. He wanted to stay in LA,</p><p>but here were too many memories.</p><p>He&#39;s renting for tax purposes,</p><p>but hopes to buy a place soon.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe you went over there</p><p>Hey, I saw you both flirting at the wake.</p><p>You are obviously into each other</p><p>Now you know he&#39;s single, you can ask him out.</p><p>Julie, I like Mr. Delfino, I do.</p><p>I just... I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready to start dating yet.</p><p>You need to get back out there.</p><p>Come on. How long has it been since you&#39;ve had sex?</p><p>Are you mad that I asked you that?</p><p>No, I&#39;m trying to remember.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to talk to you about my love life any more.</p><p>It warns me out</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t have said anything.It&#39;s just...</p><p>What?</p><p>I heard dad&#39;s girlfriend ask if you&#39;d</p><p>dated anyone since the divorce.</p><p>And dad said he doubted it.</p><p>And then they both laughed.</p><p>Hey, Susan.</p><p>Hi, Mike. I brought you a little house-warming gift.</p><p>I should&#39;ve brought something by earlier, but</p><p>Actually, you&#39;re the first to stop by. - Really?</p><p>Susan knew she was lucky.</p><p>An eligible bachelor had moved on to Wisteria Lane - Welcome</p><p>and she was the first to find out.</p><p>But she also knew that good news...</p><p>Hello there. - ...Travels quickly.</p><p>Edie Britt was the most predatory</p><p>divorce in a five-block radius.</p><p>Her conquests were numerous.</p><p>Varied.</p><p>and legendary.</p><p>Hi, Susan. I hope I&#39;m not interrupting.</p><p>You must be Mike Delfino.</p><p>Hi, I&#39;m Edie... Britt.</p><p>I live over there.</p><p>Welcome to Wisteria Lane.</p><p>Susan had met the enemy. And she was a slut.</p><p>Thank you. What&#39;s this?</p><p>Sausage puttanesca.</p><p>It&#39;s just something I threw together.</p><p>Well, thanks, Edie.</p><p>That&#39;s... great. I&#39;d invite you both in,</p><p>but I was sort of in the middle of something.</p><p>I&#39;m late for an appointment.</p><p>I just wanted to say hi.</p><p>And just like that, the race for Mike Delfino had begun.</p><p>For a moment, Susan wondered if her rivalry with Edie</p><p>would remain friendly.</p><p>Oh, Mike, I heard you&#39;re a plumber.</p><p>But she was reminded that when it came to men...</p><p>Do you think you could stop by later and take a look at my pipes?</p><p>...Women don&#39;t fight fair. - Sure.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Bye, Susan.</p><p>You can&#39;t order me around like I am a child.</p><p>Gabrielle.</p><p>No, no. I&#39;m not going.</p><p>It&#39;s business. Tanaka expects everyone to bring their wives.</p><p>Every time I&#39;m around that man, he tries to grab my ass.</p><p>I made over 200,000 doing business with him last year.</p><p>If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.</p><p>John.</p><p>Mr. Solis, you scared me.</p><p>Why is that bush there? You were supposed to dig it up last week.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have time. - I don&#39;t want to hear your excuses.</p><p>Just take care of it.</p><p>I really hate the way you talk to me.</p><p>And I hate that I spent $15,000 on your diamond necklace</p><p>which you couldn&#39;t live without.</p><p>But I&#39;m learning to deal with it.</p><p>So can I tell Tanaka we&#39;ll be there tomorrow?</p><p>John, we have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.</p><p>Thanks, Mrs. Solis.</p><p>Fine, I&#39;ll go.</p><p>But I&#39;m keeping my back pressed</p><p>against the wall the entire time.</p><p>See, now this is what a marriage is all about.</p><p>Compromise.</p><p>Is your finger ok? - Yeah, it&#39;s just a small cut.</p><p>Let me see. Mmm.</p><p>You know, Mrs. Solis, I really like it when we hook up,</p><p>but, um, you know, I got to get my work done and...</p><p>...I can&#39;t afford to lose this job.</p><p>This table was hand-carved.</p><p>Carlos had it imported from Italy.</p><p>It cost him $23,000.</p><p>You want to do it on the table this time?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Why can&#39;t we ever have normal soup?</p><p>Danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree.</p><p>Just once,</p><p>couldn&#39;t we have a soup that people have heard of?</p><p>Like French onion or navy bean.</p><p>First of all, your father can&#39;t eat onions.</p><p>He&#39;s deathly allergic. And I won&#39;t</p><p>even dignify your navy bean suggestion.</p><p>So... how&#39;s the osso buco?</p><p>It&#39;s ok. - It&#39;s ok?</p><p>Andrew, I spent three hours cooking this meal.</p><p>How do you think it makes me feel when you</p><p>say &quot;it&#39;s okay&quot; in that sullen tone?</p><p>Who asked you to spend three hours on dinner?</p><p>Excuse me?</p><p>Tim Harper&#39;s mom gets home from work,</p><p>pops open a can of pork and beans,</p><p>and boom, they&#39;re eating. Everyone&#39;s happy.</p><p>You&#39;d rather I serve pork and beans?</p><p>Apologize now. I am begging.</p><p>I&#39;m saying,</p><p>do you always have to serve cuisine?</p><p>Can&#39;t we ever just have food?</p><p>Are you doing drugs? - What?</p><p>Change in behavior is one of the warning signs,</p><p>and you have been as fresh as</p><p>paint for the last six months.</p><p>That certainly would explain</p><p>why you&#39;re always locked in the bathroom.</p><p>Trust me, that is not what he is doing.</p><p>Shut up.</p><p>Mom, I&#39;m not the one with the problem here, all right?</p><p>You&#39;re the one always acting like</p><p>she&#39;s running for mayor of Stepford.</p><p>Rex... Seeing that you&#39;re the head of this household,</p><p>I would really appreciate you saying something.</p><p>Pass thee salt?</p><p>Three days after my funeral,</p><p>Lynette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion.</p><p>Indignation.</p><p>Tom, this is my fifth message,</p><p>and you still haven&#39;t called me back.</p><p>Well, you must be having a lot of fun</p><p>on your business trip. I can only imagine.</p><p>Well, guess what -- The kids and I want to have some fun, too,</p><p>so unless you call me back by noon,</p><p>we are getting on a plane and joining you.</p><p>Mom.</p><p>Not now. Mommy&#39;s threatening daddy.</p><p>Mom. - No, I...</p><p>Where are your brothers? - Noodles, my favorite.</p><p>Lyneettee Scavo? - Crap.</p><p>Natalie Klein. I don&#39;t believe it.</p><p>Lynette. How long has it been?</p><p>Years. Uh, how are you?</p><p>How&#39;s the firm?</p><p>Good. Everyone misses you.</p><p>We all say if you hadn&#39;t quit,</p><p>you&#39;d be running the place by now.</p><p>Yeah, well.</p><p>So... How&#39;s domestic life?</p><p>Don&#39;t you just love being a mom?</p><p>And there it was. The question that Lynette always dreaded.</p><p>Well, to be honest...</p><p>For those who asked it, only one answer was acceptable,</p><p>So Lynette responded as she always did. She lied.</p><p>It&#39;s the best job I&#39;ve ever had.</p><p>You know what I don&#39;t get? - What?</p><p>Why you married Mr. Solis.</p><p>Well... He promised to give me</p><p>everything I&#39;ve ever wanted.</p><p>And did he? - Yes.</p><p>Then why aren&#39;t you happy?</p><p>Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.</p><p>So do you love him?</p><p>I do.</p><p>Well, then, why are we here? Why are we doing this?</p><p>Because I don&#39;t want to wake up one morning</p><p>with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.</p><p>Hey, can I have a drag? - Absolutely not.</p><p>You are much too young to smoke.</p><p>How would you feel about me using your</p><p>child-support payments for plastic surgery?</p><p>Stop being so nervous. You&#39;re just</p><p>asking him to dinner. No big deal.</p><p>You&#39;re right.</p><p>So is that your project for school?</p><p>You know, when I was in fifth grade,</p><p>I made the White House out of sugar cubes.</p><p>Stop stalling and go.</p><p>Before Mike figures out he can do better.</p><p>Tell me again why I fought for custody of you.</p><p>You were using me to hurt dad. - Oh, that&#39;s right.</p><p>Oh, god.</p><p>Hi. - Hey, Susan.</p><p>Are you busy?</p><p>No, not at all. What&#39;s up?</p><p>Well, I... I just, uh, was wondering if...</p><p>...if there was any chance that you, uh...</p><p>...I just wanted to ask if...</p><p>Edie. - Hey, there, Susan.</p><p>What are you...? - I was making ambrosia.</p><p>And I made too much so I thought</p><p>I&#39;d bring some over to Mike.</p><p>What&#39;s going on?</p><p>Susan was just going to ask me something.</p><p>I have a clog. - Excuse me?</p><p>And you&#39;re a plumber, right? - Yeah.</p><p>The clog&#39;s in the pipe. - Yeah,</p><p>That&#39;s usually where they are.</p><p>Well, I&#39;ve got one.</p><p>Ok. Let me get my tools.</p><p>Now? You want to come over now? You have company.</p><p>I don&#39;t mind.</p><p>Just give me two minutes. I&#39;ll be right over.</p><p>That&#39;s it.</p><p>Just stuff the hair down there. - I stuffed it.</p><p>It&#39;s not enough to clog it. - Here. Okay, look.</p><p>Put in this peanut butter</p><p>and this cooking oil.</p><p>Mom - And these olives.</p><p>Mom, I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s not working.</p><p>Oh, god. That&#39;s him.</p><p>How am I going to stop up the sink?</p><p>Well, here&#39;s your problem.</p><p>Looks like somebody stuffed</p><p>a bunch of popsicle sticks down here.</p><p>I&#39;ve told Julie a million times</p><p>not to play in the kitchen. Kids, you know.</p><p>All right, I&#39;ll go put in your orders,</p><p>And I&#39;ll be right back with your drinks</p><p>and your plates for the salad bar.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Andrew, Danielle, napkins?</p><p>They have video games.</p><p>Could we go play until our food gets here?</p><p>Andrew, this is family time. I think that we should all</p><p>Go ahead and play.</p><p>I know that you think I&#39;m angry about coming here,</p><p>but I&#39;m not.</p><p>You and the kids wanted a change of pace,</p><p>something fun I get it.</p><p>Probably we&#39;ll want</p><p>something healthier tomorrow night, though.</p><p>I&#39;m thinking about chicken Saltimbocca.</p><p>I want a divorcee.</p><p>I just can&#39;t live in this...</p><p>...this detergent commercial anymore</p><p>The salad bar&#39;s right over there. Help yourself.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Um, I think I&#39;ll go get your salad for you.</p><p>Bree Van De Kamp. - Oh. Hello, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>We didn&#39;t get a chance to talk at</p><p>Mary Alice&#39;s wake. How are you doing?</p><p>Bree longed to share the truth about</p><p>her husband&#39;s painful betrayal,</p><p>but sadly for Bree,</p><p>admitting defeat was not an option.</p><p>Great. Everything is just great.</p><p>Okay, well, I got you the honey mustard dressing.</p><p>The ranch looked just a little bit suspect.</p><p>Are we going to talk about what I said?</p><p>If you think I&#39;m going to discuss the dissolution</p><p>of my marriage in a place</p><p>where the restrooms are labeled &quot;chicks&quot; and &quot;dudes,&quot;</p><p>you&#39;re out of your mind.</p><p>What&#39;s in this?</p><p>What do you mean, what&#39;s in this? It&#39;s salad.</p><p>With... with onions. - What?</p><p>You put onions in my salad. - No, I didn&#39;t.</p><p>Oh, wait.</p><p>The sound that awakened my son was</p><p>something he&#39;d heard only once before.</p><p>Many years ago when he was quite young.</p><p>But he recognized it instantly.</p><p>It was the sound of a family secret.</p><p>Seven days after my funeral, life on Wisteria Lane</p><p>finally returned to normal.</p><p>Which, for some of my friends, was unfortunate.</p><p>Mommy, mommy! - Now what?</p><p>Daddy&#39;s home!</p><p>Come on! Hey, is anybody home?</p><p>I wasn&#39;t expecting you for a week.</p><p>I have to go back to &#39;Frisco in the morning.</p><p>But I got your call. You sounded frazzled.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>It&#39;s been a little rough. - Hi. Yeah. Peaches.</p><p>Did you buy us any presents?</p><p>Oh, god, presents. Wait up. Let me see.</p><p>Ohhh! - Yeah!</p><p>But I&#39;m not giving it to you unless</p><p>you promise to go outside right now</p><p>and practise throwing for 20 minutes. You promise?</p><p>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - Punks. Get out!</p><p>Who&#39;s open? Go out. Deeper. Deeper. Touchdown!</p><p>Oh, my god.</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>You got to be kidding. I&#39;m exhausted.</p><p>I look terrible. I&#39;m covered in peaches.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, baby. I got to have you.</p><p>Well, is it ok if I just lie here?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>I love you. - I love you more.</p><p>Wait. I gotta tell you I was having trouble with swelling.</p><p>The doctor took me off the pill.</p><p>You just gotta put on a condom.</p><p>A condom? - Yeah.</p><p>What&#39;s the big deal? Let&#39;s risk it.</p><p>Let&#39;s risk it? - Yeah.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe you tried to kill me.</p><p>Yes, well, I feel badly about that.</p><p>I told you Mrs. Huber came over</p><p>and I got distracted. It was a mistake.</p><p>Since when do you make mistakes?</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>It means I&#39;m sick of you being</p><p>so damn perfect all the time.</p><p>I&#39;m sick of the bizarre way your hair doesn&#39;t move.</p><p>I&#39;m sick of you making our bed in the</p><p>morning before I&#39;ve used the bathroom.</p><p>You&#39;re this plastic suburban housewife,</p><p>with her pearls and spatula,</p><p>who says things like &quot;we owe the Hendersons a dinner.&quot;</p><p>Where&#39;s the woman I fell in love with...</p><p>...Who used to burn the toast and</p><p>drink milk out of the carton?</p><p>and laugh.</p><p>I need her.</p><p>Not this cold, perfect thing you&#39;ve become.</p><p>These need water.</p><p>Bree sobbed quietly in the restroom for five minutes,</p><p>but her husband never knew.</p><p>Because when Bree finally emerged...</p><p>...she was perfect.</p><p>I found my earrings. We can go now.</p><p>Was John here today?</p><p>Well, yeah.</p><p>The lawn hasn&#39;t been mowed. I&#39;ve had it.</p><p>We&#39;re getting a real gardener.</p><p>Why? - Are you deaf?</p><p>I just said he&#39;s not doing his job.</p><p>It&#39;s dark. You just can&#39;t see the lawn has been mowed.</p><p>It hasn&#39;t been. Feel this grass.</p><p>I&#39;m not feeling the grass.</p><p>Let&#39;s just get going. Come on, we&#39;re late.</p><p>Take care of it. - Yes, sir.</p><p>There&#39;s Tanaka. Time for me to go and do my dance.</p><p>Good luck, sweetheart.</p><p>Excuse me. - Ma&#39;am.</p><p>You see that man just walked away?</p><p>Can you make sure he has a drink in his hand all night long?</p><p>Yes, ma&#39;am.</p><p>Susan? Susan! - Mrs. Huber, how are you doing?</p><p>Not too well, I&#39;m afraid.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to find something to soothe my stomach.</p><p>It&#39;s upset? - Yeah.</p><p>I had the worst macaroni and cheese at the wake.</p><p>It&#39;s been running through me ever since.</p><p>And I need to be at my best.</p><p>Edie Britt&#39;s son is spending the night tonight.</p><p>He&#39;s spending the night?</p><p>Apparently Edie is having a gentleman friend over for dinner,</p><p>and I think she plans on entertaining into the wee hours,</p><p>if you know what I mean.</p><p>Oh, here&#39;s some antacid. Have you ever tried this?</p><p>I can&#39;t believe it. This can&#39;t be happening.</p><p>Mike can&#39;t like Edie better than me. He just can&#39;t.</p><p>You don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.</p><p>Maybe they&#39;re just having dinner.</p><p>You&#39;re right. They&#39;re doing it.</p><p>Edie?</p><p>Edie?</p><p>Hello? Anybody home?</p><p>I need to borrow sugar.</p><p>Oh, my god! Oh, yes! Give it to me!</p><p>And just like that, the possibility Susan had clung to,</p><p>the maybe of Mike Delfino, was gone forever.</p><p>And despite the precariousness of her situation,</p><p>Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.</p><p>It didn&#39;t take Susan long to realize,</p><p>this was just not her night.</p><p>Is somebody out there?</p><p>Oh, my god! That&#39;s smoke!</p><p>Oh, my god.</p><p>She left candles unattended in the den.</p><p>Paramedic said she was lucky.</p><p>She could&#39;ve been killed.</p><p>She ran out with nothing on.</p><p>She was having sex with some guy when the fire started.</p><p>What happened to him?</p><p>He got smoke inhalation. He&#39;s at the hospital.</p><p>Susan, are you all right? You look awful.</p><p>I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m fine. I just, uh, feel really bad for Edie.</p><p>Oh, honey, don&#39;t worry about Edie. She&#39;s a strong lady.</p><p>Absolutely. She&#39;ll get through this.</p><p>She&#39;ll find a way to survive.</p><p>We all do.</p><p>Come on.</p><p>Wow! What happened? - Mike!</p><p>And suddenly there he was.</p><p>Like a phoenix rising from the ashes.</p><p>I... I thought you were... Uh... Where were you?</p><p>I just got back from the movies. Edie had a fire, huh?</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, but she&#39;s fine now.</p><p>Everything&#39;s fine now.</p><p>And just like that, Susan was happy.</p><p>Life was suddenly full of... possibilities.</p><p>Not to mention a few unexpected surprises.</p><p>Hello. - It&#39;s me.</p><p>Have anything yet? - No, nothing yet.</p><p>But don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m definitely getting closer.</p><p>I brought some champagne.</p><p>I thought we should have a toast.</p><p>The next day my friends came together</p><p>to pack away my clothes,</p><p>my personal belongings and what was left of my life.</p><p>All right, ladies, lift &#39;em up.</p><p>To Mary Alice, a good friend and neighbor.</p><p>Wherever you are, we hope you&#39;ve found peace.</p><p>To Mary Alice. - To Mary Alice.</p><p>Let&#39;s get this show on the road.</p><p>You guys, check out Mary Alice&#39;s clothes.</p><p>Size eight? Ha! She always told me she was a size six.</p><p>We found the skeleton in her closet.</p><p>Not quite, Gabrielle, not quite.</p><p>What&#39;s that? - A letter addressed to Mary Alice.</p><p>How ironic.</p><p>To have something I tried so desperately to keep secret,</p><p>treated so casually.</p><p>What are you doing? That&#39;s private.</p><p>It&#39;s open. What&#39;s the big deal?</p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. But check out the postmark.</p><p>Oh, my god. She got it the day she died.</p><p>Do you think this is why she...?</p><p>I&#39;m so sorry, girls.</p><p>I never wanted you to be burdened with this.</p><p>Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?</p><h2 id="dh-se01-e02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dh-se01-e02" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DH SE01 E02</h2><p>If Mary Alice was having some sort of crisis,</p><p>we&#39;d have known.</p><p>She lives 50 feet away, for god&#39;s sakes.</p><p>Gabby, the woman killed herlf.</p><p>Something must have been going on.</p><p>Every time I&#39;m around that man, he tries to grab my ass.</p><p>I made over $200,000 doing business with him last year.</p><p>If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.</p><p>Why aren&#39;t you happy?</p><p>Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.</p><p>What&#39;s that?</p><p>It&#39;s a letter addressed to Mary Alice.</p><p>Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?</p><p>An odd thing happens when we die.</p><p>Our senses vanish.</p><p>Taste, touch, smell, and sound</p><p>become a distant memory,</p><p>but our sight -- ah, our sight expands,</p><p>and we can suddenly see the world we&#39;ve left behind so clearly.</p><p>Of course, most of what&#39;s visible to the dead</p><p>could also be seen by the living,</p><p>if they&#39;d only take the time to look.</p><p>Like my friend Gabrielle.</p><p>I should have seen how unhappy she was,</p><p>but I didn&#39;t.</p><p>I only saw her clothes from Paris...</p><p>and her platinum jewelry...</p><p>and her brand-new diamond watch.</p><p>Had I looked closer,</p><p>I&#39;d have seen that Gabrielle was a drowning woman</p><p>desperately in search of a life raft.</p><p>Luckily for her, she found one.</p><p>Of course, Gabrielle only saw her young gardener</p><p>as a way to infuse her life with a little excitement.</p><p>But now she was about to discover</p><p>just how exciting her life could get.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>Come on, come on, come on! Hurry up! Let&#39;s go!</p><p>Where are the rest of my clothes?</p><p>I&#39;ll find them. Just get out.</p><p>Where?</p><p>Out the window. - What?</p><p>Go, go, go, go, go!</p><p>Hi, honey. You&#39;re home early.</p><p>My meeting got canceled.</p><p>Didn&#39;t you take a shower this morning?</p><p>I, uh, I just finished a workout.</p><p>Where&#39;s John?</p><p>John?</p><p>Yeah. That&#39;s his truck out front.</p><p>Gabrielle was panicked.</p><p>She knew if her husband discovered her secret,</p><p>she would feel the full force of his wrath.</p><p>Hey, Mr. Solis.</p><p>Hey, John, take care of that ficus yet?</p><p>I&#39;ll get to it as soon as I&#39;m done here. - All right.</p><p>But she was quickly reminded that...</p><p>What Carlos couldn&#39;t see...</p><p>Yeah, sure. No problem.</p><p>couldn&#39;t hurt her.</p><p>The peaceful facade of Wisteria Lane had recently been shattered,</p><p>first by my suicide...</p><p>and then by the discovery of a note among my belongings</p><p>that suggested a suspicious reason for my desperate act.</p><p>My friends gathered to discuss its implications.</p><p>I think we should give it to Paul.</p><p>He&#39;s still mourning, Susan.</p><p>He&#39;ll probably freak out.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter. She was his wife.</p><p>He deserves to have all the facts.</p><p>Well, we could do it gently.</p><p>We could tell him about it over coffee and pastry.</p><p>That would be fun.</p><p>&quot;Paul, we have proof your wife killed herself</p><p>over some deep, dark secret.</p><p>Another bear claw?&quot;</p><p>We could always call the police.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s just some sort of sick joke.</p><p>Well, if it was a joke, it was in very poor taste.</p><p>No, this was serious. I know it was.</p><p>We got to find out what was going on.</p><p>Let&#39;s say we do.</p><p>There&#39;s a chance we&#39;re not going to like what we find.</p><p>Well, isn&#39;t it worse to be in the dark?</p><p>I mean, imagining she did all these horrible things.</p><p>It&#39;s the age-old question, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>How much do we really want to know about our neighbors?</p><p>My friends were right to be concerned.</p><p>They knew that every family has its secrets,</p><p>and as my son and husband could have told them,</p><p>you need to think carefully before digging them up.</p><p>After talking for hours,</p><p>my friends still hadn&#39;t agreed on</p><p>what to do with the note.</p><p>So they decided to talk about it in the morning</p><p>after a good night&#39;s rest.</p><p>But no one could fall sleep that night.</p><p>They each kept thinking of my suicide</p><p>and how terribly alone I must have felt.</p><p>You see, loneliness was something</p><p>my friends understood all too well.</p><p>It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m up.</p><p>Good.</p><p>I have a question for you.</p><p>OK.</p><p>Do you remember when you proposed?</p><p>For god&#39;s sake --</p><p>We sat on Skyline Drive and drank a bottle of apple wine,</p><p>and when we finished it, you turned to me, and you said,</p><p>&quot;if you marry me, Bree Mason,</p><p>I promise to love you for the rest of my life.&quot;</p><p>And even though I was engaged to Ty Grant,</p><p>and even though my father didn&#39;t like you,</p><p>I said yes.</p><p>That was a long time ago.</p><p>You&#39;re going to cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer,</p><p>and we&#39;re going to find ourselves a marriage counselor.</p><p>Bree... - You promised.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Good. I&#39;m going to go, uh, make myself some warm milk.</p><p>Would you like something to drink?</p><p>Anything but apple wine.</p><p>Susan awoke that night alone and parched,</p><p>but as she gazed out her window,</p><p>she saw the tall drink of water she needed to quench her thirst.</p><p>&quot;Dear diary, Mike doesn&#39;t even know I&#39;m alive.&quot;</p><p>Shut up.</p><p>If you want to date him, you&#39;re going to have to ask him out.</p><p>I keep hoping he&#39;ll ask me out.</p><p>How&#39;s that going?</p><p>Shouldn&#39;t you be making brownies</p><p>for your nerdy friends?</p><p>I can&#39;t find the measuring cup. Have you seen it?</p><p>The measuring cup?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I -- well, it&#39;s -- it&#39;s got to be here somewhere.</p><p>Just keep looking.</p><p>I know you&#39;re awake.</p><p>I know you&#39;re a jerk.</p><p>Dinner with Tanaka ran long. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>You know, Carlos, I didn&#39;t marry you</p><p>so I could have dinner by myself six times a week.</p><p>You know how bored I was today?</p><p>I came this close to actually cleaning the house.</p><p>Don&#39;t be that way. I got you a gift.</p><p>Nope. No, no, no, no.</p><p>You&#39;re not going to buy your way out of this one.</p><p>It&#39;s a good gift.</p><p>Is that white gold?</p><p>Yeah. Put it on...</p><p>and then make love to me.</p><p>I&#39;m not in the mood.</p><p>But we could stay up and talk.</p><p>When a man buys a woman expensive jewelry,</p><p>there are many things he may want in return, for future reference,</p><p>conversation ain&#39;t one of them.</p><p>Hey, that was a joke. - Yeah, right.</p><p>What the hell is wrong with you? - Let go of me.</p><p>Hey, you&#39;ve been acting like a nightmare for a month. What&#39;s wrong?</p><p>I can&#39;t fix it unless you tell me.</p><p>It&#39;s not exciting anymore, Carlos.</p><p>So what am I supposed to do?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>Be the way you used to be.</p><p>Surprise me. Take my breath away.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Hey, Susan. - Mike.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong?</p><p>I didn&#39;t realize anybody was going to be out here.</p><p>I just sort of rolled out of bed.</p><p>I&#39;m sure you look fine.</p><p>Oh, Bongo, stop.</p><p>Sorry, uh... he scares easy.</p><p>No, it-- it&#39;s fine. I-I get it.</p><p>I didn&#39;t mean to disturb you.</p><p>I&#39;ll see you later.</p><p>Do you want to have dinner with me?</p><p>Just the two of us?</p><p>Well... and Julie.</p><p>It&#39;s a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighborhood,</p><p>we invite them over for a home-cooked meal.</p><p>Sort of a tradition.</p><p>I thought you were a lousy cook.</p><p>Well, I order take-out.</p><p>You invite &#39;em for home-cooking and give &#39;em take-out?</p><p>Yeah, ah, it&#39;s sort of a new tradition.</p><p>I&#39;m working out the kinks.</p><p>I&#39;ll tell you what. How about I cook?</p><p>You guys come over to my place.</p><p>Oh, great.</p><p>Friday night at six? - I&#39;ll be there.</p><p>Right. Come on.</p><p>Bye, Bongo.</p><p>Julie! Mike Delfino just invited us</p><p>to dinner Friday night.</p><p>He did? Cool.</p><p>But only I&#39;m going because you&#39;re</p><p>gonna come down with something serious</p><p>that requires bed rest and fluids.</p><p>Julie was glad Susan was rekindling her love life.</p><p>Of course, she was unaware of her</p><p>mother&#39;s recent track record with fire.</p><p>It&#39;s all gone. Everything my ex-husband</p><p>worked for all those years, gone.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about clothing.</p><p>I already started a collection from the neighborhood.</p><p>What? I don&#39;t want to wear other people&#39;s old crap.</p><p>Edie, you can be homeless or ungracious.</p><p>You really can&#39;t afford to be both.</p><p>That reminds me. My insurance check still hasn&#39;t come yet.</p><p>Could I stay with you a few more weeks?</p><p>Of course. What kind of christian would I be</p><p>if I denied shelter to a friend in need?</p><p>Oh, look. Here&#39;s something we can salvage.</p><p>Your measuring cup.</p><p>We can scrape of the burnt part and</p><p>it&#39;ll look good as new.</p><p>That&#39;s not my cup. Mine was plastic.</p><p>Well, how did it get in here?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. Who cares?</p><p>Now, would you put that down and start looking for jewelry?</p><p>Dr. Albert Goldfine was the most accomplished</p><p>marriage counselor in the city.</p><p>He had dealt with problems ranging from substance abuse...</p><p>...to infidelity...</p><p>...to domestic violence.</p><p>Yes, Dr. Goldfine thought he had seen it all.</p><p>And then he met the Van de Kamps.</p><p>Hi. I&#39;m Bree. And this is my husband Rex.</p><p>And I brought you some homemade potpourri.</p><p>The answer is yes.</p><p>You&#39;re about to make a fortune off us.</p><p>Ah, get off! - Boys!</p><p>Guys, I&#39;m begging you.</p><p>Sit in your seats.</p><p>I&#39;m not gonna tell you again. Buckle up.</p><p>I mean it, so help me...</p><p>Oh, shoot. Crap!</p><p>I was playing with it first!</p><p>License and registration, please.</p><p>Ma&#39;am, you know why I pulled you over?</p><p>I have a theory.</p><p>The kids should be sitting wearing seat belts.</p><p>I yelled at them. They never listen. It&#39;s very frustrating.</p><p>You have to find a way to control them.</p><p>After all, that&#39;s your job.</p><p>Though he&#39;d been a policeman for six years,</p><p>officer Hayes had never found himself</p><p>in a truly dangerous situation.</p><p>Then again, he had never before told</p><p>a woman how to raise her children.</p><p>Are you saying I&#39;m a bad mother?</p><p>Get back in your car, please.</p><p>I have no help. My husband&#39;s always away on business.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna have to ask you to step back now.</p><p>My babysitter joined the witness relocation program.</p><p>I haven&#39;t slept through the night...</p><p>...in six years - Ma&#39;am.</p><p>And for you to stand there and judge me...</p><p>Ok. I&#39;m not gonna give you a ticket.</p><p>I&#39;m just gonna let you off with a warning.</p><p>I accept your apology.</p><p>Mom! He&#39;s kicking me again!</p><p>Buckle up.</p><p>Mrs. Solis. - Hello, Jonathan.</p><p>Well, this is my room. Sorry about the mess.</p><p>Oh, uh, don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p>You just missed my mom.</p><p>On friday,she coaches my sister&#39;s soccer team.</p><p>Yes, I heard that.</p><p>John, we need to talk about what happened the other day.</p><p>Mr. Solis isn&#39;t catching on, is he?</p><p>No, no, he doesn&#39;t have a clue, god love him.</p><p>It&#39;s just I was thinking that when you come over to garden,</p><p>you might actually have to garden.</p><p>Great, you&#39;re breaking up with me.</p><p>In my own bedroom.</p><p>No, no. I&#39;m not dumping you.</p><p>Lately, you&#39;ve been the only thing keeping me going.</p><p>But we can&#39;t do it at my house anymore.</p><p>Oh, so then, where do you want to do it?</p><p>Well, what time does your mom get back from soccer practise?</p><p>Mrs. Solis!</p><p>Better hurry. We don&#39;t have much time.</p><p>And so there&#39;s just the four of us.</p><p>My older son, Andrew, is 16, Danielle is 15 and...</p><p>I don&#39;t need to see pictures. Bree,</p><p>you&#39;ve spent most of the hour</p><p>engaging in small talk.</p><p>Oh, have I ? - Yes.</p><p>Rex has been very vocal about his issues.</p><p>Don&#39;t you want to discuss your feelings about your marriage?</p><p>Um, doc...</p><p>This is the thing you got to know about Bree.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t like to talk about her feelings.</p><p>To be honest, it&#39;s hard to know if she has any.</p><p>Does she feel anger, rage, ecstasy?</p><p>Who knows?</p><p>She&#39;s always pleasant, and I can&#39;t</p><p>tell you how annoying that is.</p><p>Whatever she feels, it&#39;s so far below the surface,</p><p>no one can see it.</p><p>I feel like she&#39;s using all these...</p><p>Bree?</p><p>Bree? - What? I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>Would you like to respond to what Rex just said?</p><p>Oh, um... - Is there some truth there?</p><p>Do you use housework as a way to disengage emotionally?</p><p>Of course not!</p><p>This is great. I got tons of homework tonight.</p><p>It&#39;s easy to concentrate after sex.</p><p>I&#39;m glad I could help.</p><p>Education&#39;s very important.</p><p>Oh, I got something for you.</p><p>I was gonna give it to you next time I</p><p>mowed your lawn, but since you&#39;re here.</p><p>Oh, it&#39;s a rose. - It&#39;s not just any rose.</p><p>Look at all the petals. There&#39;s no flaws.</p><p>It&#39;s perfect. - Oh, John.</p><p>Just like you.</p><p>The truth hit her like a thunderbolt.</p><p>I spent days looking for just the right one.</p><p>I finally found it.</p><p>For John,</p><p>this was no longer a meaningless little affair.</p><p>Gabrielle could now clearly see</p><p>he was falling in love with her.</p><p>It&#39;s just beautiful.</p><p>I... I got to go.</p><p>Goodbye.</p><p>Hey, you. What are we having?</p><p>I talked to Julie and she suggested rib-eye steaks.</p><p>She said that&#39;s your favorite. - I love my steak.</p><p>Hi, Mike.</p><p>Susan.</p><p>Edie.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry about your house. How you holding up?</p><p>All right, I guess. Oh, is somebody having a party?</p><p>No, Susan&#39;s just throwing me</p><p>a traditional welcome dinner.</p><p>Only I&#39;m cooking. And having it at my house.</p><p>Traditional? Hm! I didn&#39;t get one.</p><p>Oh, it&#39;s a new tradition.</p><p>It won&#39;t be anything fancy. Just a little home cooking.</p><p>Mm. That sounds so good.</p><p>Susan suddenly had an awful</p><p>feeling in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>I&#39;ve been having nothing but fast food lately.</p><p>As if she was watching an accident in slow motion.</p><p>She knew it would happen, but was powerless to stop it.</p><p>Edie, would you like to join us for dinner?</p><p>Oh, that&#39;s so sweet. No, I don&#39;t</p><p>want to intrude. Three&#39;s a crowd.</p><p>No, it&#39;s not like that. I mean, Susan&#39;s bringing Julie.</p><p>It&#39;s not like that. The more the merrier.</p><p>Well, this&#39;ll be fun. - All right. Tomorrow night.</p><p>We&#39;ll eat at six. - Great.</p><p>Oh, and Susan... - Yeah?</p><p>This&#39;ll make up for the dinner that you never threw me.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Ta-ta.</p><p>Should I have told her we were having steak.</p><p>She&#39;s not a vegetarian or something?</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>No, Edie&#39;s definitely a carnivore.</p><p>Here&#39;s, um...</p><p>Here&#39;s what I pulled for Edie.</p><p>Most of the clothes aren&#39;t that stylish.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about it. Edie&#39;s a beggar now,</p><p>which means she can&#39;t be a chooser.</p><p>Of course, we don&#39;t have to add salt to the wound.</p><p>Listen, I was just getting dinner ready...</p><p>Say no more. I&#39;ll get out of your hair.</p><p>No, no.</p><p>By the way, was that you I saw getting pulled</p><p>over by a policeman?</p><p>Yeah, the boys were acting up in the car,</p><p>I couldn&#39;t get them to sit down.</p><p>Young boys can be so willful.</p><p>I try everything.</p><p>I scream. I threaten. I reason.</p><p>I beg. Nothing works.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because</p><p>they&#39;re too young and they don&#39;t understand,</p><p>or if they&#39;re just getting some perverse joy out of testing me.</p><p>My mother used to have the worst time with me in the car,</p><p>so one time when I was acting up,</p><p>she stopped and left me on the side of the road,</p><p>and she drove off.</p><p>You&#39;re kidding?</p><p>Oh, she came back immediately,</p><p>but I never misbehaved in the car again.</p><p>You should try that.</p><p>Mrs. Huber, I could never leave</p><p>my kids by the side of the road.</p><p>When it comes to discipline,</p><p>sometimes you must be creative.</p><p>My mother knew that. Smart lady.</p><p>Of course, she&#39;s in a home now.</p><p>And her mind has just turned to mush.</p><p>Well, like I said, I should go back and get dinner ready.</p><p>Oh, right, well... Goodbye.</p><p>Goodbye.</p><p>Susan, have you been able to find old clothes for Edie?</p><p>She has nothing to wear.</p><p>I thought that was the look she was going for.</p><p>Oh, Susan, Edie may be trash,</p><p>but she&#39;s still a human being.</p><p>Zach, is your dad home? I need to talk to him.</p><p>Hey, Paul, I hope I&#39;m not interrupting.</p><p>Actually, I was getting ready to go somewhere.</p><p>I just wanted to come by and say hello,</p><p>you know, see how you guys are doing.</p><p>We&#39;re trying to move on. It&#39;s been pretty tough.</p><p>I can only imagine.</p><p>Not knowing why Mary Alice...</p><p>Why what? - Why she did it.</p><p>Oh. Here, let me help you. - I&#39;ve got it. I&#39;ve got it.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry if I upset you.</p><p>Can I be frank?</p><p>Of course.</p><p>I don&#39;t care what her reasons were.</p><p>Maybe she was depressed, maybe she was bored.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p>She abandoned her husband and her son</p><p>and I&#39;ll never forgive her.</p><p>As I watched Susan, I couldn&#39;t help feeling sorry for her.</p><p>She wanted so much to know why I did it.</p><p>Why I killed myself.</p><p>It&#39;s not enough to want the truth.</p><p>You must know where to look for it.</p><p>And the truth is elusive</p><p>because it knows where to hide.</p><p>Hello, Julie, I talked to your mom</p><p>about donating some clothes for Edie.</p><p>She&#39;s at Mrs. Van De Kamp&#39;s,</p><p>but I&#39;ll see if she left some stuff upstairs.</p><p>Oh, Julie, I-I was, um, just admiring your new measuring cup.</p><p>Yeah, we&#39;ve lost ours. - Really?</p><p>So I couldn&#39;t find the clothes. Sorry.</p><p>That&#39;s ok.</p><p>If you want me to keep looking.</p><p>No. You&#39;ve done more than enough.</p><p>Truly.</p><p>Bree. Rex just called. He won&#39;t be able to meet you here today.</p><p>Apparently, there was an emergency at the hospital.</p><p>Oh, well, I wish he&#39;d called me.</p><p>He suggested perhaps you&#39;d like to meet with me by yourself.</p><p>You&#39;ve been very quiet in our joint sessions.</p><p>What?</p><p>Oh, oh, oh, no, thank you.</p><p>I have some things I need to do today.</p><p>Are you sure? - Uh, yeah, I&#39;m sure.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Dr. Goldfine, there is something you can do for me.</p><p>What&#39;s that? - Take off your coat.</p><p>So you&#39;re taking Julie on your dinner date with Mike?</p><p>Well, if Edie&#39;s gonna be there,</p><p>I&#39;ll need emotional support.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe she wormed her way in.</p><p>How did you let her do that?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. I was going to take her out at the knees,</p><p>but it all happened so fast.</p><p>Well, you know what you need to do.</p><p>You need to get there early,</p><p>spend a little time with Mike before the little barracuda gets there.</p><p>That&#39;s a good idea. Edie will get there at 5:45,</p><p>which means her breasts will arrive at 5:30,</p><p>so I should shoot for 5:00.</p><p>That a girl.</p><p>I&#39;m just going to take these upstairs.</p><p>I&#39;m going to keep my one little bag and go home.</p><p>That is a beautiful rose. Where did you get it?</p><p>Oh, John gave it to me.</p><p>John... your gardener, he gave you a rose?</p><p>Yes... I am having some new bushes planted outside,</p><p>and he gave me that as a color palette.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Sure is beautiful, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>Yes, it is.</p><p>I&#39;m sure Freud would not approve of this.</p><p>Oh, who cares what he thinks?</p><p>I took psychology in college.</p><p>We learned all about Freud.</p><p>A miserable human being.</p><p>What makes you say that?</p><p>Think about it.</p><p>He grew up in the late 1800s.</p><p>There were no appliances back then.</p><p>His mother had to do everything by hand,</p><p>just backbreaking work from sun up to sundown.</p><p>Not to mention the countless</p><p>other sacrifices she had to make</p><p>to take care of her family, and what does he do?</p><p>He becomes famous peddling a theory</p><p>that the problems of most adults</p><p>can be traced back to</p><p>something awful their mother has done.</p><p>She must&#39;ve felt so betrayed.</p><p>He saw how hard she worked.</p><p>He saw what she did for him.</p><p>Did he even ever think to say thank you?</p><p>I doubt it.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>Just so you know, many of Freud&#39;s</p><p>theories have been discredited.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Boys, I am not gonna tell you again. Sit.</p><p>I mean it. I am serious.</p><p>You guys are gonna be in so much trouble</p><p>if you don&#39;t sit back in those seats.</p><p>For the first time,</p><p>Lynette could see this was not the innocent play of children.</p><p>She was being challenged.</p><p>So she decided it was time to get creative.</p><p>Out! Can&#39;t behave,</p><p>you heard me, you cannot ride.</p><p>You, out, move it.</p><p>Where is she going?</p><p>Ok. Mommy&#39;s a genius.</p><p>Five, six, all right.</p><p>Uh, mommy&#39;ll be right back.</p><p>Boys? Boys?</p><p>Boys?!</p><p>Porter! Preston! Parker!</p><p>If you&#39;re hiding, you&#39;ve got to stop now,</p><p>cause mommy doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s funny!</p><p>Oh! excuse me.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m looking for my boys.</p><p>Three boys with red hair. Have you seen them?</p><p>Yeah. I also saw you drive away and leave them.</p><p>I know. I was just trying to scare them into behaving.</p><p>Did you see where they went?</p><p>Yeah, they&#39;re in my kitchen.</p><p>Listen, it seems to me that you</p><p>have some anger management issues.</p><p>I have four kids under six.</p><p>I absolutely have anger management issues.</p><p>I think you need to talk to somebody</p><p>because abandoning your children...</p><p>I didn&#39;t abandon them. I came back.</p><p>I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s not normal.</p><p>My kids aren&#39;t normal</p><p>and now I don&#39;t have time for this, lady, so --</p><p>Boys, get out here.</p><p>I don&#39;t think they should go anywhere</p><p>until you calm down.</p><p>Get in the car. - She&#39;s got cookies.</p><p>Bring them, we&#39;re leaving. - Stay put.</p><p>I don&#39;t think so. Oh! - Listen, lady...</p><p>Leave my mommy alone. - Let go of me.</p><p>What&#39;s the matter with you? - Son of bi... Ah!</p><p>Run, boys, run! - Come on!</p><p>Oh, crap. - Get back here.</p><p>Boys, you&#39;re gonna need to put on your...</p><p>Get back or I&#39;m gonna call social services.</p><p>Oh, my god! Carlos, what have you done?</p><p>I saw it when I drove by the dealership.</p><p>I thought Gabrielle will look beautiful in this.</p><p>Carlos!</p><p>It cost me an arm and a leg.</p><p>It&#39;s got GPS navigation, 200 watt stereo system...</p><p>It is beautiful.</p><p>So did I take your breath away?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Is it the best gift you&#39;ve ever gotten?</p><p>Gabrielle could see what this gesture had cost Carlos,</p><p>so she responded the only way she knew how.</p><p>She had a feeling the truth would&#39;ve</p><p>been lost on her husband anyway.</p><p>After all, it&#39;s the rare man who understands the value</p><p>of a single perfect rose.</p><p>Susan. - I hope you don&#39;t mind.</p><p>I came by early to help you set up.</p><p>Oh, um... - Hey, Susan.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry, we have everything under control.</p><p>Bongo! I don&#39;t know why he barks at you.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t take it personally.</p><p>Dogs are very sensitive.</p><p>What&#39;s up, Bongo?</p><p>You never know what freaks them out, huh?</p><p>In the distance, Susan thought she heard a bell ring.</p><p>Is it a strange noise?</p><p>What is it? A weird smell?</p><p>Round one...had started.</p><p>All I&#39;m saying is</p><p>this whole it takes two to mess</p><p>up a marriage theory is bull.</p><p>The problems that we have are because of her.</p><p>That is not true, Rex.</p><p>What have I been doing for the past</p><p>20 years that&#39;s been so awful?</p><p>You&#39;re not saying anything because</p><p>I&#39;ve been a great husband.</p><p>And it kills you to admit that.</p><p>Rex, I&#39;m curious.</p><p>Do you ever acknowledge the benefits of living with Bree?</p><p>Huh? - By your own admission,</p><p>your home&#39;s always clean,</p><p>your clothes always freshly pressed,</p><p>sounds like a wonderful cook,</p><p>despite her flaws,</p><p>do you ever remember to say thank you?</p><p>Thank you? - Yes.</p><p>Bongo! Get down! Down!</p><p>Go away. - Down. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>So who&#39;s the guy that lives across from Mrs. Huber again?</p><p>That&#39;s Mr. Mullen. If he invites you in,</p><p>you have to meet all of his pets.</p><p>That&#39;s ok. I love animals.</p><p>He&#39;s a taxidermist.</p><p>Oh, ok, thanks for the warning.</p><p>Isn&#39;t Mr. Mullen&#39;s brother your divorce attorney?</p><p>Uh, yes, yes, he was.</p><p>Can I say something?</p><p>In my heart, I still believe that you</p><p>and Karl are gonna get back together.</p><p>Really? - Oh, yeah.</p><p>I&#39;ve never seen two people more in love.</p><p>She&#39;s never gonna find that kind of</p><p>chemistry with another man. Never.</p><p>It was everything Susan could do to keep a smile on her face.</p><p>Round two was underway,</p><p>and she was already taking a beating.</p><p>You know, Mrs. Britt...</p><p>What Edie hadn&#39;t counted on...</p><p>I always liked...</p><p>Susan had someone in her corner.</p><p>Mr. Rothwell, your fourth husband.</p><p>He was my second husband. I&#39;ve only been married twice.</p><p>Twice? You weren&#39;t married to the tattooed</p><p>guy they took away in handcuffs?</p><p>No, Julie, she wasn&#39;t married to Javier.</p><p>That was just one of her special friends.</p><p>I think we should change the subject.</p><p>Unless you want to keep talking about it.</p><p>Bongo, get down. - Wait.</p><p>Let me show you something. - He loves that gravy.</p><p>Come. While you were in there tossing a salad,</p><p>I taught him something.</p><p>Up. Oh...</p><p>Susan was furious with Edie</p><p>for using a dog to ingratiate herself with its owner.</p><p>She was also furious with Mike for not</p><p>seing through this blatant maneuver.</p><p>But mostly...</p><p>...I&#39;m gonna get the desserts.</p><p>...She was furious with herself for not having thought of it first.</p><p>I can barely get him to sit.</p><p>Best dog ever. Yes, you are.</p><p>I&#39;ve never seen him walk on two legs.</p><p>He knows who to come to.</p><p>Here&#39;s your dessert.</p><p>Thank you. Mike, this looks yummy.</p><p>Oh, look at that. Looks like bongo&#39;s</p><p>finally warming up to Susan.</p><p>Ooh, we just got off on the wrong foot.</p><p>We&#39;re best buddies now.</p><p>Oh, what a good boy!</p><p>Bango, are you ok? - What&#39;s wrong with him?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>I&#39;ve never heard him make that sound.</p><p>You ok, fella? - Mom?</p><p>You all right?</p><p>Where is your earring?</p><p>You ok?</p><p>Call the vet, the number&#39;s on the fridge.</p><p>Tell him I&#39;ll be right there.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry.</p><p>I&#39;ll stay here and get everything cleaned up.</p><p>Thanks, Edie.</p><p>Is there anything I can do?</p><p>No.</p><p>How&#39;s Bongo doing?</p><p>I&#39;m waiting to see if they&#39;ll have to operate.</p><p>Oh, god!</p><p>I stopped and I got this for...</p><p>I am just so sorry for this.</p><p>I&#39;m really sorry I snapped at you. I just...</p><p>Oh, no, it&#39;s ok. - Good news.</p><p>We won&#39;t have to do surgery. - Oh, that&#39;s great.</p><p>We&#39;ve given him something to help pass the earring.</p><p>When he does, would you like us to retrieve it for you?</p><p>I&#39;m gonna say no.</p><p>Ok. You should be able to take him home in about an hour.</p><p>Wow. You must be so relieved.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, I was just really worried.</p><p>It was your dog. I get it.</p><p>Actually, he was my wife&#39;s dog,</p><p>one of the last thing&#39;s she said to</p><p>me in the hospital before she died</p><p>was to be sure I looked after</p><p>him and I promised her I would.</p><p>And just like that,</p><p>Susan could suddenly see something she&#39;d never seen before.</p><p>He, uh, meant so much to her.</p><p>Mike Delfino was still in love with his late wife.</p><p>And if something had happened,</p><p>I would&#39;ve felt like I&#39;d failed her.</p><p>I know that sounds stupid, but...</p><p>And she knew right then,</p><p>neither she nor Edie would be laying</p><p>claim to his heart any time soon.</p><p>No, it doesn&#39;t. Not at all.</p><p>So she decided, for now, she could</p><p>settle for just being his friend.</p><p>This is for you.</p><p>Well, for Bongo. You give it to him.</p><p>Yes, as I look back at the world I left behind,</p><p>it&#39;s all so clear to me.</p><p>The beauty that waits to be unveiled.</p><p>The mysteries that long to be uncovered</p><p>But people so rarely stop to take a look.</p><p>They just keep moving.</p><p>It&#39;s a shame, really.</p><p>There&#39;s so much to see</p><h2 id="dh-se01-e03" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dh-se01-e03" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DH SE01 E03</h2><p>She was his wife.</p><p>He deserves to have all the facts.</p><p>She abandoned her husband and her son and I&#39;ll never forgive her.</p><p>It&#39;s the age-old question,</p><p>how much do we want to know about our neighbors?</p><p>You gonna cancel the meeting with the divorce lawyer.</p><p>We&#39;ll find a marriage councilor.</p><p>I&#39;m Mike Deifino.</p><p>Susan Mayer. I live across the street.</p><p>If you wanna dating him,</p><p>you&#39;re gonna have to ask him out.</p><p>I keep hoping he&#39;ll ask me out.</p><p>I really hate the way you talk to me.</p><p>I really hate that I spent $15,000 on your diamond necklace,</p><p>but I&#39;m learning to deal with it.</p><p>Do you love him? - I do.</p><p>So then why are we here? Why are we doing this?</p><p>Because I don&#39;t want to wake up one morning,</p><p>With a sudden urge to blow my brains out.</p><p>After I died,</p><p>I began to surrender the parts of</p><p>myself that were no longer necessary.</p><p>My desires, beliefs, ambitions, doubts --</p><p>every trace of my humanity was discarded.</p><p>I discovered when moving through eternity,</p><p>it helps to travel lightly.</p><p>In fact, I held on to only one thing</p><p>my memory.</p><p>It&#39;s astonishing to look back on the world I left behind</p><p>I remember it all -- every single detail.</p><p>Like my friend Bree Van de Kamp.</p><p>I remember the easy confidence of her smile,</p><p>the gentle elegance of her hands,</p><p>the refined warmth of her voice.</p><p>But what I remember most about Bree</p><p>Rex, wasn&#39;t that lovely --</p><p>Was the look of fear in her eyes.</p><p>Bree had started to realize her world was unraveling,</p><p>and for a woman who despised loose ends,</p><p>that was unacceptable.</p><p>Rex. Rex. You need to get up.</p><p>It&#39;s not even light out.</p><p>Please hurry.</p><p>If the kids see you sleeping down here,</p><p>they&#39;re going to start asking questions.</p><p>Let &#39;em ask. I don&#39;t care anymore.</p><p>Well, I care.</p><p>They don&#39;t need to be burden with our marital problems</p><p>While we&#39;re working things out, the least</p><p>we can do is try to keep up appearances.</p><p>Oh, yeah. Appearances.</p><p>I keep forgetting about appearances.</p><p>Oh, Rex, you look so tired.</p><p>I didn&#39;t sleep.</p><p>This damn thing is so uncomfortable.</p><p>Well, why don&#39;t you move back upstairs and sleep in our bed?</p><p>We&#39;re in marriage counseling, Bree.</p><p>I think that would confuse things.</p><p>It&#39;s just--</p><p>I miss you.</p><p>I know you do.</p><p>Of course, if I don&#39;t find out start</p><p>getting some sleep, pretty soon</p><p>I&#39;ll be forced to move back upstairs out of sure exhaustion.</p><p>Yes, Bree was afraid of many things,</p><p>but if there was one thing she wasn&#39;t afraid of...</p><p>it was a challenge.</p><p>The day on Wisteria Lane began like any other.</p><p>With a cup of coffee and the moring paper.</p><p>Just give me a second....</p><p>And while Lynette read the business section.</p><p>And Gabrielle studied the fall collections</p><p>And Bree searched for decorating ideas</p><p>Susan scanned the front page and saw something</p><p>that caught her eye</p><p>What&#39;s about time.</p><p>Be nice. I come bearing snacks.</p><p>Lynette, these cards are sticky</p><p>I know. Preston used the three of diamonds</p><p>to took scoop jam out of the jar.</p><p>Gorgeous, thankful we have 49 cards to play with.</p><p>Hello. Sorry I&#39;m late.</p><p>So, Susan and I was just telling the girls,</p><p>I want to throw a dinner party</p><p>Really? - Yes.</p><p>Well how long have we all lived on this street</p><p>we&#39;ve never done a big group thing</p><p>I think it&#39;s a great idea</p><p>Paul never likes to have people over</p><p>but the heck with him I&#39;m doing it.</p><p>So when is this shindig?</p><p>How about a month from tonight?</p><p>That would be the 16th. Good for everyone?</p><p>Works for me. Should we all make something?</p><p>Oh, no. This is my party.</p><p>I&#39;ve been wanting to have everyone over for years.</p><p>I&#39;m so happy we&#39;re finally doing this.</p><p>It&#39;s gonna be so much fun.</p><p>I know. Her dinner.</p><p>How could we have all forgotten about this?</p><p>We didn&#39;t exactly forget, it&#39;s just usually</p><p>when the hostess dies the party&#39;s off.</p><p>Lynette</p><p>I&#39;m not being flip. I&#39;m just pointing out a reality.</p><p>Mary Alice was so excited about it.</p><p>It&#39;s so sad.</p><p>I think we should go through with it.</p><p>Really? Wouldn&#39;t that be in poor taste?</p><p>No. It&#39;s sort of a way to honor Mary Alice.</p><p>It was so important to her</p><p>We could all use a fun night.</p><p>Well, good, because I have some new flour</p><p>that I have been just dying to show off.</p><p>Lynette?</p><p>I&#39;m in. - I&#39;ll make braised lamb shanks.</p><p>I&#39;m still in.</p><p>So how many I will be cooking for?</p><p>Seven. Three couples and Susan. Does that sound right?</p><p>No, it sounds very, very wrong.</p><p>Is there somebody you&#39;d like to invite?</p><p>I have an idea.</p><p>A dinner party.</p><p>Honey, I may be working late.</p><p>The Dillman proposal&#39;s a complete mess.</p><p>No, no, you promised to be home every night this week.</p><p>I&#39;ll try but I can&#39;t guarantee anything.</p><p>This is business.</p><p>Says the prince as he rides off into the sunset.</p><p>Boy the movies ever get that wrong.</p><p>You know what your problem is?</p><p>You&#39;re very tense.</p><p>You should go to a spa or go shopping.</p><p>Find a way to relax.</p><p>Hello?</p><p>Where are you?</p><p>Algebra.</p><p>You free at 4:00?</p><p>I&#39;m not sure. I got track after school.</p><p>Well, get here as fast as you can.</p><p>My husband says I need to relax.</p><p>You, uh, want me to keep my gym clothes on like last time?</p><p>If you would, please.</p><p>A dinner party?</p><p>Yeah, it&#39;ll be fun.</p><p>Bree&#39;s cooking, everyone&#39;s coming.</p><p>You know what? I haven&#39;t even had</p><p>a chance to unpack yet, honey.</p><p>I just, uh, I just need to chill out for the next few days.</p><p>Oh, Tom.</p><p>There&#39;ll be liquor and hors d&#39;oeuvres and</p><p>grownups without children and -- and silverware.</p><p>Remember silverware?</p><p>Honey, can you take this in for me?</p><p>Have you heard anything I just said?</p><p>Yeah, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m just -- I&#39;m wiped out.</p><p>Three cities in six days -- my head is just pounding.</p><p>I&#39;m not ready for a dinner party.</p><p>I already got a sitter.</p><p>Can you cancel her?</p><p>Please? Look, let&#39;s just stay in tomorrow night.</p><p>We can get a bottle of wine and rent a video,</p><p>and-I just want to hang out with my best gal.</p><p>That&#39;s all.</p><p>I was looking so forward to a night out.</p><p>I know, sweetie, I&#39;m sorry, but...</p><p>I&#39;m beat.</p><p>I mean, do you remember what it</p><p>was like to work a 60-hour week?</p><p>A dinner party?</p><p>Do I have to go?</p><p>Well, given that we&#39;re hosting it, I&#39;d say so.</p><p>By the way, you won&#39;t be drinking at this party.</p><p>Why is that?</p><p>Because when you drink, you get chatty.</p><p>No one needs to know that we&#39;re seeing Dr. Goldfine.</p><p>You know, if you spent half as much time working</p><p>on our problems as you do covering them --</p><p>Not a drop.</p><p>You know, this -- this is ridiculous.</p><p>And this whole thing about us taking tennis lessons?</p><p>Well, the nurses at your office may start wondering</p><p>why you&#39;re disappearing three times a week.</p><p>Tennis lessons are a plausible alibi.</p><p>All right so, these tennis lessons we&#39;re taking --</p><p>how are we doing?</p><p>My backhand&#39;s improving immensely,</p><p>but you&#39;re still having problems with your serve.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>A dinner party?</p><p>It&#39;s tomorrow night, so if you could</p><p>just keep Julie an extra day.</p><p>Fine, but that&#39;s all. Brandi and I leave</p><p>sunday for a week up at the cabin.</p><p>What cabin?</p><p>Brandi wanted some place where we could get away.</p><p>Escrow just closed yesterday.</p><p>You can afford a cabin,</p><p>but you can&#39;t scrape up child support?</p><p>The check is in the mail.</p><p>Oh. No, it&#39;s not.</p><p>I found my dental guard. I&#39;m ready.</p><p>Stop fighting.</p><p>We are being as nice as we possibly can to one another.</p><p>Like I said, stop fighting.</p><p>Excuse me, Brandi.</p><p>Do you mind?</p><p>Oh, okay.</p><p>Wait. Susan, you&#39;re right there. You can pick it up.</p><p>I could, but she&#39;s the one who threw it.</p><p>Come on. Don&#39;t be petulant.</p><p>Just pick up the stupid can.</p><p>No.</p><p>I can pick it up.</p><p>Honey, stay out of this.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>This is so typical.</p><p>Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Was that petulant, too?</p><p>You know what? You can pick up the damn can yourself.</p><p>Yeah, well, you just go to hell.</p><p>You want me to pick it up?</p><p>Mrs. Warmington said she looked for</p><p>mom&#39;s obituary and couldn&#39;t find it.</p><p>Did you put one in?</p><p>I&#39;ve had other things on my mind, Zack.</p><p>But how could you not do that?</p><p>People are going to think we didn&#39;t care about her.</p><p>I doubt people will give it much thought.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p>You never talk about her.</p><p>She hasn&#39;t even been dead a month,</p><p>and it&#39;s like you&#39;ve totally forgotten she ever existed.</p><p>It&#39;s a little early for this kind of talk.</p><p>Maybe when you die,</p><p>I won&#39;t put in an obituary.</p><p>That will be your choice to make.</p><p>Assuming you outlive me.</p><p>Mom, it&#39;s no big deal.</p><p>Carlos and I are driving in for the baptism.</p><p>Problem solved.</p><p>Okay, fine.</p><p>You go with aunt Maria,</p><p>and I will take Nana to church.</p><p>Take your clothes off.</p><p>Okay. I got to go, mom.</p><p>Yes, right now.</p><p>Okay, you can give me directions later. Bye.</p><p>Hi. How was school?</p><p>Got an a-minus on my biology exam.</p><p>You did?</p><p>Well, let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve learned.</p><p>Who&#39;s that?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>Hey, you!</p><p>So did Mike say anything?</p><p>No, but, god, you should have seen the look on his face.</p><p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that bad.</p><p>I mean, he&#39;s coming to the party, right?</p><p>I left three messages.</p><p>Oh, he&#39;s not going to come. Big surprise.</p><p>I did everything but foam at the mouth.</p><p>God, I hate when I get that way.</p><p>It&#39;s like every time I get within 10 feet</p><p>of Carl, I just become this monster.</p><p>You know what? It&#39;s not going to change until</p><p>you resolve your issues with that man.</p><p>What, you mean forgive him?</p><p>You know, I&#39;ve lived with this bitterness</p><p>so long, I think I&#39;d be lonely without it.</p><p>Honey, get a pet.</p><p>See ya.</p><p>Son of a - It&#39;s a business meeting.</p><p>It&#39;s a frat party.</p><p>Regional manager, corporate manager, head of sales.</p><p>Margarita, cigar, sombrero.</p><p>Honey, what do you want me to do, sit around</p><p>the hotel the whole time watching cable?</p><p>No. But when I say,</p><p>&quot;we&#39;ve been invited to a party,&quot;</p><p>Don&#39;t whine about your exhausting 60-hour week.</p><p>Put on your dancin&#39; shoes and take the</p><p>mother of your children out for a good time.</p><p>Fine. You know what? You&#39;re right.</p><p>Let&#39;s go to that party.</p><p>I can&#39;t. I already canceled the sitter.</p><p>Okay, well, we&#39;ll throw the next one.</p><p>Throw a dinner party?</p><p>I don&#39;t even have time to wash my face.</p><p>No, you know what?</p><p>I&#39;m going to go to this one.</p><p>You can stay home and babysit the kids.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>I can handle that.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Gabrielle spent her morning searching</p><p>for the mysterious little girl.</p><p>Sadly for her,</p><p>the mystery was solved a bit too quickly.</p><p>What&#39;s going on?</p><p>Have you met Ashley?</p><p>Found it!</p><p>Babe, this is Sheila Bukowski, our new neighbor.</p><p>They just moved into the miller&#39;s old house.</p><p>My daughter left her ball in your yard. I&#39;m so sorry.</p><p>Oh, oh, no -- no problem.</p><p>Nice to meet you, Ashley.</p><p>She&#39;s shy. She doesn&#39;t say much.</p><p>Yeah, but I can see her little mind working away.</p><p>Nice meeting you.</p><p>Come on, Ashley.</p><p>Private sessions?</p><p>I don&#39;t understand. Why do we need private sessions?</p><p>Private sessions allow us to work on</p><p>the personal issues of both partners.</p><p>Oh, well, I don&#39;t have any personal issues.</p><p>My only issue is that my husband wants to leave me,</p><p>and how can I work on that if he&#39;s not in the room?</p><p>There are things I need to discuss with</p><p>Dr. Goldfine, and I can&#39;t have you there.</p><p>Why?</p><p>I&#39;m your wife. You can say anything in front of me.</p><p>All we need is a few more sessions, and I&#39;m sure we can --</p><p>Damn it, Bree,</p><p>a few more sessions isn&#39;t going to fix us.</p><p>This is bigger than that.</p><p>Why don&#39;t we do it this way?</p><p>Rex, you can take the first half-hour.</p><p>Bree, you can take the second.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>Oh, and, doctor,</p><p>if what he&#39;s about to discuss has anything to do with</p><p>adultery, prostitution, or internet pornography,</p><p>I would really appreciate you taking a moral hard line.</p><p>Hi, Ashley.</p><p>Remember me? We -- we met earlier.</p><p>Aren&#39;t you the little artist?</p><p>What are those -- flamingos?</p><p>No.</p><p>Well, they&#39;re very pretty.</p><p>It almost looks like they&#39;re kissing.</p><p>Funny thing about kissing --</p><p>It&#39;s not just for husbands and wives.</p><p>Sometimes we kiss our mom or our grandpa.</p><p>Sometimes we even kiss our dog. Ha ha.</p><p>Sometimes we even kiss people who are just our friends,</p><p>kind of like a high-five on the lips. Right?</p><p>Hey, Ash,</p><p>I was at the mall, and I saw this.</p><p>I thought you might like it.</p><p>She&#39;s Hawaiian.</p><p>Her name is princess Kahalua,</p><p>and I think it means &quot;little waterfall,&quot;</p><p>or &quot;big pond&quot; or something.</p><p>So we&#39;re good, right?</p><p>Well, you enjoy your new little friend,</p><p>and if there&#39;s anything else you need, you just let me know.</p><p>What I&#39;d really like</p><p>is a bike.</p><p>Where did you find that?</p><p>She used this to kill herself.</p><p>Why would you keep it?</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because I thought we might need it someday.</p><p>For what?</p><p>Protection.</p><p>I want to talk about mom.</p><p>You need to take your medication.</p><p>We are going to talk about mom.</p><p>Hello, Zack.</p><p>I hope this isn&#39;t a bad time.</p><p>What can I do for you, Mrs. Van de Kamp?</p><p>Well, I wanted to invite you and your</p><p>father to a dinner party tomorrow night.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure where he is right now.</p><p>Oh. Well, I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s such late notice, but, well,</p><p>we weren&#39;t sure that you and your father were</p><p>ready for any kind of social engagement yet,</p><p>but, we&#39;re sort of throwing it in your mother&#39;s honor.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Yes, it&#39;s just going to be a casual night with the gang.</p><p>We&#39;re going to eat and tell fun stories about your mom.</p><p>Zack... Are you okay?</p><p>Hello, Bree.</p><p>Oh, hi, Paul. I was just --</p><p>I heard.</p><p>Thank you, but we already have plans for tomorrow.</p><p>Oh. That&#39;s too bad.</p><p>Well, I should go.</p><p>Thank you, Mrs. Van de Kamp.</p><p>For what, Zack?</p><p>Remembering my mom.</p><p>That night, Paul gave his son something</p><p>to calm his nerves,</p><p>And the next day, Gabrielle calmed her own nerves</p><p>by giving something to her new best friend.</p><p>Here you go.</p><p>Top of the line, 3-speed, aluminum frame,</p><p>handlebar ribbons, and a bell,</p><p>and you&#39;ll notice it&#39;s royal blue</p><p>to match your pretty little eyes.</p><p>My eyes are green.</p><p>Yeah, well, you&#39;ll be cruising so fast</p><p>on this, no one will even notice.</p><p>It&#39;s all yours, hon.</p><p>Have fun.</p><p>What? What&#39;s wrong?</p><p>I don&#39;t know how to ride a bike.</p><p>What?</p><p>Well, then, why did you ask for one?</p><p>Why can&#39;t you show me?</p><p>Sure, one of these days.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong with now?</p><p>After her talk with Lynette,</p><p>Susan decided to take a look at her old photo album,</p><p>and she began to see herself in a whole new light,</p><p>and the picture wasn&#39;t flattering.</p><p>Yeah, you got Karl. Leave a message.</p><p>Hey, Karl, it&#39;s me.</p><p>I was hoping you&#39;d be there.</p><p>Um, listen, we need to talk,</p><p>so maybe when you drop Julie off tomorrow,</p><p>we could have a moment.</p><p>It&#39;s important.</p><p>Give my best to...</p><p>Brandi.</p><p>Call me.</p><p>Susan was proud of herself.</p><p>She was finally ready to let go of her anger.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>The boys will be hungry at 5:30,</p><p>so put the fish sticks in the toaster oven at 5:00.</p><p>For half an hour. Honey, I know.</p><p>This is the third time you&#39;ve told me.</p><p>Well, if the food&#39;s late, god help you.</p><p>Beautiful, I don&#39;t need a pamphlet.</p><p>It&#39;s not brain surgery.</p><p>They&#39;re just kids, for god sake.</p><p>Preston, would you come here?</p><p>Sweetie,</p><p>you know our rule about eating cookies, right?</p><p>Yeah, we can&#39;t have them after 5:00,</p><p>cause sugar makes us hyper.</p><p>Yeah, but tonight, anything goes.</p><p>Make sure you share with your brothers.</p><p>Thanks, mom.</p><p>Don&#39;t look at your feet. Don&#39;t look at your feet.</p><p>Look at the road. Look at the road. Good.</p><p>Find your balance. Find your balance.</p><p>Okay, it&#39;s all you. It&#39;s all you! you&#39;re doing great!</p><p>Okay, stay to the right. Watch the car.</p><p>Watch the car! Watch the car!</p><p>Oh! Are you okay?</p><p>Yeah. Let&#39;s go again.</p><p>Oh, honey, these heels don&#39;t have another block in them.</p><p>What about tomorrow?</p><p>Well, you won&#39;t be around tomorrow, &#39;cause you have school.</p><p>I&#39;m homeschooled.</p><p>I&#39;m always around.</p><p>It was in that moment that Gabrielle</p><p>realized this ride was far from over.</p><p>I&#39;m coming!</p><p>Karl, what are you doing here? I asked you to come tomorrow.</p><p>You said you wanted to talk. It sounded important.</p><p>Tomorrow. I&#39;m in a towel.</p><p>We were married 14 years.</p><p>I know what&#39;s under there. Come on.</p><p>I&#39;m not really ready for this.</p><p>I was going to have a whole speech prepared.</p><p>Brandi and I have plans tomorrow.</p><p>I suggest you wing it.</p><p>Um, okay.</p><p>Here&#39;s the thing, Karl --</p><p>I was thinking about what happened</p><p>in the driveway yesterday,</p><p>and I-I just don&#39;t want to --</p><p>I don&#39;t want to live like that.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to be that kind of person,</p><p>and I just thought if the two of us,</p><p>you know, if we had a nice, calm --</p><p>I need an apology, Karl.</p><p>A what?</p><p>An apology for the way you ended our marriage.</p><p>You never took any responsibility for your behavior.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what to say, Susan.</p><p>The heart wants what it wants.</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>I fell in love.</p><p>While you were married to someone else.</p><p>The heart wants what it wants.</p><p>Yeah, well, my heart wants to hurt you,</p><p>But I can control myself.</p><p>I-I don&#39;t want to go back to that ugly place, really,</p><p>and if you do, I suggest that you get some help.</p><p>You know what?</p><p>I don&#39;t need an apology.</p><p>I don&#39;t need anything from you.</p><p>You&#39;re humiliating yourself.</p><p>No, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s been humiliated, Karl.</p><p>Why don&#39;t you see that?</p><p>You walked out on your family.</p><p>People think you&#39;re scum, not me,</p><p>so worry about yourself. I&#39;m okay with me.</p><p>I can walk down the street and hold my head high.</p><p>As the sun slowly settled on Wisteria Lane,</p><p>an unsettled Susan racked her brain</p><p>to find a way into her own house.</p><p>Lying naked in her shrubs,</p><p>it occurred to Susan this could be the</p><p>most humiliating moment of her life.</p><p>Susan?</p><p>She was wrong.</p><p>Uh, whatcha doing?</p><p>Locked myself out...</p><p>naked.</p><p>And then I fell.</p><p>So how are you?</p><p>I just got back.</p><p>I&#39;ve been gone all day,</p><p>and I got your messages about dinner,</p><p>and, um, I would love to come if that invite still stands.</p><p>It&#39;s a date.</p><p>All right. I, um...</p><p>assume the dress is casual.</p><p>Yeah. It&#39;s -- it&#39;s casual.</p><p>Thanks for helping me break in.</p><p>Do you think it&#39;ll be hard to replace that screen?</p><p>It depends.</p><p>If you nail it in yourself, you might want to wear gloves...</p><p>Or pants. Pants wouldn&#39;t hurt.</p><p>Okay, I know what just happened is funny in theory,</p><p>but I&#39;m nowhere near ready to laugh about it,</p><p>so please, no jokes.</p><p>Hey, where have you two been?</p><p>Uh, Susan had a problem finding something to wear.</p><p>Oh, is that the kind of thing you meant?</p><p>Pretty much.</p><p>The kids are bouncing off the walls? Huh.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m sure you can figure a way to put them to bed, Tom.</p><p>I mean, for god sakes, Tom, they&#39;re just kids.</p><p>Hey. Are you okay?</p><p>Yes, I-I went jogging today,</p><p>and I think I just pushed myself too hard.</p><p>Oh, you&#39;re probably not wearing the right shoes.</p><p>Yea, that thought did cross my mind.</p><p>So Gabrielle says that you and Bree are</p><p>taking lessons three times a week.</p><p>I&#39;m actually thinking about playing again.</p><p>I mean, it&#39;s such great exercise.</p><p>Mm. That it is.</p><p>And my drop shot could use a serious tune-up.</p><p>Think you can give me the number of your pro?</p><p>Yeah. I&#39;ll, uh, I&#39;ll give it to you later.</p><p>Well, what club does he work out of?</p><p>W-We&#39;re not really taking tennis lessons, Carlos.</p><p>You&#39;re not?</p><p>That&#39;s a story</p><p>Bree concocted to cover the fact that</p><p>we&#39;re seeing a marriage counselor.</p><p>Bree -- Bree...</p><p>He wouldn&#39;t stop asking about the tennis pro.</p><p>Bree and I are in marriage counseling.</p><p>Everyone knows our secret now.</p><p>Did the sky fall?</p><p>Has your life come crashing down?</p><p>If everybody would please take your seats,</p><p>dinner is served.</p><p>With the winds from the northwest at 4 miles per hour,</p><p>it&#39;s currently 55 degrees.</p><p>Now we go to rich... live on the scene in Westbrook.</p><p>A grisly discovery was made today in Westbrook</p><p>when a chest was found in Rockwater Lake,</p><p>discovered by a local area businessman and</p><p>his grandson while they were fishing.</p><p>Investigators recovered a wooden chest</p><p>containing what appears to be human remains.</p><p>Now, a police spokesman says the body was --</p><p>Okay, I got to break the ice here.</p><p>So you&#39;re in counseling. Big deal.</p><p>You want humiliation?</p><p>I&#39;ll give you humiliation.</p><p>I locked myself out of my house</p><p>stark naked and got caught by Mike.</p><p>Oh, my god. When did this happen?</p><p>Today, right before the party.</p><p>What can I say? Right place, right time.</p><p>I think I can top that. Try getting thrown</p><p>out of Disneyland for lewd behavior.</p><p>What? When was this?</p><p>When Tom and I were first married,</p><p>things got a little out of hand on Mr. Toad&#39;s Wild Ride.</p><p>You&#39;re kidding.</p><p>No. We got perp walked down main street, USA.</p><p>Well, since we&#39;re doing true confessions,</p><p>Carlos and I once broke a waterbed in Cancoon.</p><p>How&#39;d you manage that?</p><p>Well, he used to have a thing for spiked heels.</p><p>I&#39;d just like to make it clear -- she was wearing them.</p><p>Rex cries after he ejaculates.</p><p>You think we left too early?</p><p>I was thinking we left too late.</p><p>So is, uh, Rex gone for good?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>God, I hope not.</p><p>I mean, they&#39;ve always been wound a little tight,</p><p>but I&#39;ve never seen them like that.</p><p>Then again, who am I to judge?</p><p>You mean people who live in glass</p><p>houses shouldn&#39;t throw soda cans?</p><p>Okay, you have got to know that I</p><p>only get that angry around Karl.</p><p>He just treated me so badly at the end.</p><p>I haven&#39;t been able to get past it.</p><p>Well, maybe he did you a big favor.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>Let&#39;s look at Karl as a starter marriage</p><p>you know, boot camp.</p><p>Preparing you for something better next time.</p><p>Listen, Mike...</p><p>About the whole seeing me naked thing, I...</p><p>I don&#39;t -- I just want to thank you for</p><p>being such a... perfect gentleman.</p><p>Oh, I wasn&#39;t a perfect gentleman.</p><p>I might have snuck a peek.</p><p>Good night.</p><p>And, um, for what it&#39;s worth...</p><p>Wow.</p><p>How was your night?</p><p>We are raising little terrorists.</p><p>You know that, don&#39;t you?</p><p>Oh. You didn&#39;t have a good time?</p><p>Okay, you know what? Drop the act.</p><p>I know you gave them cookies.</p><p>Oh. Who cracked, anyway?</p><p>Porter.</p><p>So how was your, uh, dinner party?</p><p>Well, there was dinner, but it wasn&#39;t much of a party.</p><p>Uh-oh. What happened?</p><p>I don&#39;t know.</p><p>Rex announced that he and Bree are in counseling.</p><p>She retaliated with this whole revelation</p><p>which I won&#39;t even go into now,</p><p>and the bottom line is he stormed out.</p><p>Clearly, there&#39;s trouble in paradise.</p><p>Honestly, I&#39;m not that surprised.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. I just never got the</p><p>idea that they were really happy.</p><p>Are we happy?</p><p>Man, oh, man.</p><p>I keep seeing that look on Rex&#39;s face,</p><p>and then him taking off like that.</p><p>Some night.</p><p>Then again, I would probably cry, too,</p><p>if I had to have sex with that woman.</p><p>I mean, you watch a man get torn down like that,</p><p>it makes you wonder why he let her get away with it.</p><p>Believe me, if a woman ever</p><p>humiliated me like that in public,</p><p>Hm-- it would only happen once.</p><p>So, uh, where are you going?</p><p>I&#39;ll be staying at the motor lodge.</p><p>The hotel by the Interstate has better rates,</p><p>and it&#39;s closer to your work.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>I&#39;m packing your swimsuit.</p><p>There&#39;s a pool there,</p><p>and I know how swimming relaxes you.</p><p>When our kids ask where I am, what are you going to say?</p><p>I could tell them that you went to tennis camp.</p><p>That was a joke.</p><p>Yeah. I got it.</p><p>Obviously, if you&#39;ve forgotten anything,</p><p>you can, um, come right back and get it.</p><p>Well, I&#39;ll call you.</p><p>Rex.</p><p>In college, when we first started dating,</p><p>people were so jealous of us.</p><p>We were the golden couple.</p><p>Everybody knew we were going to have this wonderful life.</p><p>Why is this happening?</p><p>Because you can&#39;t even let me pack my own suitcase.</p><p>All right, see ya. Have fun.</p><p>Where are you going?</p><p>Just a sec.</p><p>Mom?</p><p>Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not packing heat.</p><p>Hey, Brandy, would you scoot a little?</p><p>Just scoot. Thank you.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>I&#39;ll be quick.</p><p>Brandy, I&#39;m sorry for the way I treated you.</p><p>It was uncalled for and childish,</p><p>and it won&#39;t happen again.</p><p>I have built up a lot of anger towards you, both of you,</p><p>and I realize now that I just</p><p>can&#39;t carry that around anymore,</p><p>so apology or no apology,</p><p>I&#39;m moving on.</p><p>Mrs. Mayer?</p><p>Brandy.</p><p>Brandy, get in the car.</p><p>Mrs. Mayer.</p><p>Please, call me Susan.</p><p>I just wanted you to know</p><p>what happened between me and Karl,</p><p>things got out of hand.</p><p>Because I thought your marriage was over.</p><p>Anyway, I just wanted you to know</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I really am.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>And though it came from an unexpected source,</p><p>Susan finally got the apology she&#39;d always wanted.</p><p>Hey. Let me take those.</p><p>You&#39;re wearing a really big hat.</p><p>Yes, I am.</p><p>Listen, the kids are watching a video,</p><p>which means that we&#39;ve got only about 45</p><p>minutes until they actually find Nemo,</p><p>so I suggest that we make the most of it.</p><p>By reliving your night out with the guys?</p><p>Lynette...</p><p>I&#39;m trying.</p><p>You look... ridiculous in that thing.</p><p>Sexy ridiculous?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>I can live... with maybe.</p><p>You know, it&#39;s going to take more than just this one night.</p><p>I know.</p><p>Looks like we have an audience.</p><p>Let &#39;em look.</p><p>As long as they don&#39;t try and cut in.</p><p>Dr. Goldfine.</p><p>Bree. We&#39;re not scheduled now, are we?</p><p>I didn&#39;t have time to make an appointment.</p><p>Rex moved out today.</p><p>Oh, I&#39;m very sorry to hear that,</p><p>but unfortunately, I&#39;m completely booked right now.</p><p>I don&#39;t need much time.</p><p>It just seems that you have more insight into my situation</p><p>than I do, and I just think --</p><p>Bree, we can&#39;t talk now.</p><p>If you could just tell me what he told you,</p><p>then I could fix the problem.</p><p>I can&#39;t do that. It&#39;s completely unethical.</p><p>Well, why can&#39;t you --</p><p>That&#39;s my next appointment.</p><p>You really need to go.</p><p>Dr. Goldfine, please.</p><p>Hold on. I&#39;ll go and talk to my client.</p><p>Bree searched for Rex&#39;s audiotape</p><p>hoping to find answers.</p><p>She found answers, all right,</p><p>but to entirely different questions.</p><p>I understand completely.</p><p>I&#39;ll -- I&#39;ll be out in just a minute.</p><p>Bree, I&#39;m -- I&#39;m sorry. He can&#39;t wait,</p><p>but I can see you first thing</p><p>in the morning -- 8:00.</p><p>8:00.</p><p>Sorry to interupt.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>Yes, I remember the world --every detail.</p><p>And what I remember most is how afraid I was.</p><p>What a waste.</p><p>You see, to live in fear is not to live at all.</p><p>I wish I could tell this to those I left behind,</p><p>but would it do any good?</p><p>Probably not.</p><p>I understand now --</p><p>there will always be those who face their fears...</p><p>And there will always be those who run away.</p><h2 id="dh-se01-e04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dh-se01-e04" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DH SE01 E04</h2><p>Anybody home?</p><p>Susan played with fire... - That&#39;s not my cup.</p><p>And could get burned.</p><p>Go to a spa, go shopping.

Yes, this is me.</p><p>But, unfortunately for Lynette,</p><p>this new label frequently fell short of what was advertised.</p><p>How in the world did they...?</p><p>I left the door to the art supply</p><p>cupboard open for five minutes.</p><p>That&#39;s all. - Five minutes.</p><p>The little girl, why didn&#39;t she say anything?</p><p>Your boys work quickly.</p><p>Well, obviously they will be punished for this severely.</p><p>I hesitate bringing this up, since you</p><p>got so ugly about it last time...</p><p>They don&#39;t have attention deficit disorder,</p><p>and I won&#39;t drug my boys</p><p>just to make your job easier.</p><p>I&#39;d rather change teachers.</p><p>The boys are in my class because I&#39;m the</p><p>only teacher who can handle them.</p><p>What if we separate the twins,</p><p>put them in different classes?</p><p>They&#39;re much calmer when they&#39;re not bouncing off one another.</p><p>We can try that, but if it doesn&#39;t work,</p><p>we may no longer be able to accommodate them.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to Lynette,</p><p>her label was about to change yet again.</p><p>And for the next few years, she would be known as</p><p>the mother of the boys who painted Tiffany Axelrod blue.</p><p>It looked to be an interesting afternoon on Wisteria Lane.</p><p>A mysterious cassette tape had</p><p>been discovered by my friend Bree.</p><p>She had stolen it from her marriage counselor.</p><p>A counselor I&#39;d once spoken to in strictest confidence.</p><p>So how have you been?</p><p>I had the nightmare again.</p><p>It&#39;s weird to hear Mary Alice.</p><p>Still the same one? - Yes.</p><p>But this time I was standing in a river</p><p>and I saw the girl under the water.</p><p>She kept screaming &quot;Angela&quot; over and over again.</p><p>What do you think the significance of the name &quot;Angela&quot; is?</p><p>Actually, that&#39;s my real name.</p><p>Her real name?</p><p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen her driver&#39;s license. I did not say Angela.</p><p>Bree, what does it say in the rest of the tape?</p><p>Just more about her nightmares,</p><p>and this girl she was afraid of.</p><p>So what the hell do we do now?</p><p>I think we should show Paul the note.</p><p>Are you sure? He&#39;s gonna freak.</p><p>It&#39;s now or never.</p><p>I saw what he&#39;s asking for the place.</p><p>It&#39;s gonna sell quickly.</p><p>Can I say something?</p><p>I&#39;m glad Paul&#39;s moving. - Gaby.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. He&#39;s just always given my the creeps.</p><p>Haven&#39;t you guys noticed, he has this dark thing going on?</p><p>Something about him just feels...</p><p>Malignant? - Yes.</p><p>We&#39;ve all sort of felt it.</p><p>That being said, I do love what he&#39;s done with that lawn.</p><p>Mom, the dish is clean.</p><p>I still don&#39;t understand why you don&#39;t just</p><p>ask him out on an official date date.</p><p>I&#39;m trying a new strategy. I&#39;m playing hard to get.</p><p>How long do you think you can keep that up?</p><p>Maybe until noon.</p><p>Then I&#39;m going to have to run over there</p><p>and beg him to love me.</p><p>Uh, mom, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re</p><p>gonna be able to wait that long.</p><p>You got to be kidding.

Stop it! No. No.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna take the whole table. That&#39;s right.</p><p>Come on now. I mean it.</p><p>I love taking baths. Especially with you.</p><p>It&#39;s like taking a vacation from the world.</p><p>I hated taking baths when I was a kid.</p><p>Of course, back then,</p><p>the only thing I had to play with was my rubber ducky.</p><p>Who&#39;s that?</p><p>It&#39;s Mr. Solis.</p><p>Relax. Carlos is at work and he doesn&#39;t ring the doorbell.</p><p>It&#39;s the cable guy. He&#39;s three hours late.</p><p>Use the side entrance.</p><p>Gabrielle knew her vacation from the world had ended.</p><p>What she didn&#39;t know was John had left behind a souvenir.</p><p>I&#39;m telling dad didn&#39;t come home last night.</p><p>They had a fight. A bad one. - How bad?</p><p>Like divorce court bad.</p><p>Listen to her.</p><p>She always overcompensates when she&#39;s worried.</p><p>If dad moves out and leaves us with her,</p><p>I&#39;ll lose my mind.</p><p>Dinner is on the table.</p><p>Mom, where did dad go last night?</p><p>He got a last minute call to speak at</p><p>a medical conference in Philadelphia.</p><p>Take your seats.</p><p>This marriage is so over.</p><p>Andrew?</p><p>Again sorry I was late.</p><p>The scheduler overbooked me.</p><p>How long are you going to be? - Almost done.</p><p>What is that scent? Is that sage and citrus?</p><p>That&#39;s amazing.</p><p>Try to hurry. I have stuff to do.</p><p>Come on.</p><p>What&#39;s happening?</p><p>The cable guy fell.</p><p>He hit his head on the tub. He may have a concussion.</p><p>It&#39;s almost eight. - He was late.</p><p>Mrs. Huber.</p><p>Hello, Susan. I made you a pie.</p><p>Oh, wow! Why?</p><p>Do I need a motive to do something nice?</p><p>I can&#39;t wait for you to try this.</p><p>It&#39;s mincemeat.</p><p>Actually, I just had dinner.</p><p>That&#39;s ok. You can save it for later.</p><p>What&#39;s so funny?</p><p>I was just thinking of that expression,</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll make mincemeat out of you&quot;.</p><p>Mincemeat used to be an entrap of mostly chopped meat,</p><p>so it was like saying,</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll chop you up into little bits.&quot;</p><p>but that was centuries ago.</p><p>Today, mincemeat is mostly made of</p><p>fruit, spices and rum.</p><p>There&#39;s no meat in it and still people say,</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll make mincemeat out of you.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t know that people really say that anymore.</p><p>I do.</p><p>So, Susan, how are you?</p><p>I&#39;m fine.</p><p>Good. You know, I have a confession to make.</p><p>I&#39;ve always wish I&#39;d been more supportive when Karl left you.</p><p>Oh, you don&#39;t have to apologize about Karl.</p><p>Really, Karl and I are over.</p><p>I&#39;ve moved on. - Yes, I know.</p><p>You&#39;ve moved on to that nice Mike Delfino.</p><p>He&#39;s quite a catch, isn&#39;t he?</p><p>You like him, don&#39;t you?</p><p>Ah, sure, as a friend.</p><p>Oh, Susan.</p><p>Being coy is a strategy best employed</p><p>by virgins at their first dance.</p><p>For women of our age,</p><p>it&#39;s just annoying.</p><p>You sure you don&#39;t want pie?</p><p>No, thank you.</p><p>I hope it works out with you and Mike.</p><p>You&#39;ve been so desperate to land him.</p><p>What? I am not desperate.</p><p>Good lord, Susan,</p><p>you burned your rival&#39;s house down.</p><p>If that isn&#39;t desperate,</p><p>I don&#39;t know what is.</p><p>Mrs. Huber, with all due respect, you&#39;re crazy.</p><p>What&#39;s that? - I think you recognize it.</p><p>I found it in the ruins of Eddie&#39;s home.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s not... - Shh. My point is this.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t there for you when Karl left,</p><p>but I am here for you now.</p><p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is our secret.</p><p>And no one ever need know.</p><p>Oh, Susan.</p><p>You don&#39;t know how good it feels</p><p>to finally be able to help you.</p><p>You look so pale.</p><p>Now, I insist you try some of my pie.</p><p>Go on.</p><p>Did I mention it&#39;s mincemeat?</p><p>Open the door, please. - Hang on.</p><p>What? - May I come in?</p><p>No. - I want to talk to you.</p><p>Then talk. - Where were you last night?</p><p>Brian&#39;s. - I just spoke to Brian&#39;s mother.</p><p>Tell me again where you were last night,</p><p>and this time don&#39;t lie to me.</p><p>Where did you say dad was again? In Philadelphia?</p><p>Andrew, don&#39;t change the subject.</p><p>Sorry, I thought the subject was telling lies.</p><p>I called dad&#39;s cell phone.</p><p>I know he moved out.</p><p>Well, it&#39;s just temporary and...</p><p>...I thought it would upset you so I was protecting you.</p><p>Whatever. You lied.</p><p>So stop pretending like you have</p><p>some sort of moral authority.</p><p>Andrew, just because I chose not to</p><p>share my marital problems with you</p><p>doesn&#39;t give you the right to be rude.</p><p>How about driving my father away.</p><p>Do I get to be rude then?</p><p>What&#39;s this?</p><p>It&#39;s a sock. - It&#39;s a man&#39;s sock.</p><p>I found it under our bed.</p><p>It&#39;s not mine.</p><p>Oh, for god sakes, Carlos, it&#39;s Yao Lin&#39;s.</p><p>Our maid wears size 13 gym socks?</p><p>No, she dusts with them.</p><p>See? Socks instead of rags.</p><p>Susan, hello. - Mrs. Huber.</p><p>Did you and Mike come together?</p><p>I saw him over in the fresh produce aisle.</p><p>No. Like I told you. We&#39;re just friends.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>By the way, if I didn&#39;t make it clear yesterday,</p><p>I absolutely did not do that thing you accuse me of.</p><p>Hey, Susan. Hey, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>Nice to see you, Mike.</p><p>Hey. You like Alfred Hitchcock?</p><p>They&#39;re doing a retrospective at the rialto.</p><p>Uh... ...I&#39;m not really a fan.</p><p>Come on, how can you not like Hitchcock?</p><p>I just, uh, don&#39;t.</p><p>Oh. Ok.</p><p>Well, uh, nice to see you.</p><p>You too, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>You&#39;re so silly.</p><p>Pretending not to like him on my account.</p><p>I mean, really.</p><p>Will you just drop it?</p><p>You shouldn&#39;t be rude to me.</p><p>Your secret is not an easy burden to bear.</p><p>That insurance company is putting Eddie through hell.</p><p>But still I&#39;ve said nothing. - Well...</p><p>The longer it takes for her payment,</p><p>the longer she&#39;ll be staying with me.</p><p>Eating me out of house and home. Using up my hot water.</p><p>What exactly is it you want from me, Mrs. Huber?</p><p>Are these together?</p><p>Ring it up.</p><p>If the school and the pediatrician</p><p>think the twins could be medicated,</p><p>then what&#39;s the problem?</p><p>I used to run a company with 85 people,</p><p>and now I can&#39;t wrangle three</p><p>small boys without doping them?</p><p>Talk about feeling like a failure.</p><p>Lynette, you are a great mother.</p><p>But, let&#39;s face it,</p><p>your kids are a challenge.</p><p>Thank you. That&#39;s the nicest way you could&#39;ve said that.</p><p>You know, the truth is</p><p>when they&#39;re not making me want to tear my hair out,</p><p>they&#39;re actually really sweet.</p><p>I&#39;m afraid if I change the bad stuff,</p><p>I&#39;m going to change the good stuff.</p><p>It&#39;s a tough call.</p><p>Like this mug.</p><p>I love this mug. If I medicate them,</p><p>will they still make me a mug like this?</p><p>You know, it&#39;s leaking.</p><p>Yeah, I know.</p><p>We talked to Paul. We told him</p><p>we need to show him something.</p><p>He&#39;s on his way over.</p><p>So, Paul, we notice that you&#39;re selling the house.</p><p>Yes, too many painful memories. I&#39;m sure you understand.</p><p>Before you move, we thought there&#39;s something you should know.</p><p>It seems there may be more to Mary Alice&#39;s</p><p>death than you are aware of.</p><p>Remember when you asked us to pack her things?</p><p>Well, when we did, we found a note.</p><p>And we think that you should have it.</p><p>You can see from the postmark,</p><p>Mary Alice probably got it the day she died.</p><p>Paul, are you going to be okay? - No.</p><p>Have you always cleaned with socks? - Yes.</p><p>What is that, a Japanese thing?</p><p>I am Chinese.</p><p>I don&#39;t like lying.</p><p>I don&#39;t like your ironing, so there.</p><p>Mrs. Solis, what are you doing here?</p><p>Carlos found this under the bed.</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>It&#39;s ok. It was close call,</p><p>but I managed to cover.</p><p>I got you these, so from now on,</p><p>we can&#39;t let Carlos see you wearing</p><p>anything resembling a gym sock.</p><p>You want me to mow your lawn in sandals.</p><p>I could lose a toe.</p><p>Imagine what you&#39;d lose if he finds out</p><p>you&#39;re trimming more than the hedge.</p><p>Why are your friends staring at me?</p><p>Did you tell them about us? - No.</p><p>They&#39;re staring &#39;cause they think you&#39;re hot.</p><p>Oh... Ok.</p><p>It&#39;s 9:30. What is your brother thinking?</p><p>Want my advice? Call dad.</p><p>Tell him to go kick Andrew&#39;s ass.</p><p>I am perfectly capable of handling this without your father.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. - Where&#39;s your cell phone?</p><p>Call Andrew. Find out where he is.</p><p>He&#39;ll know you&#39;re behind this.</p><p>He won&#39;t. Just act normal.</p><p>Hey, it&#39;s me. Ah, what&#39;s going on?</p><p>He knows.</p><p>Andrew, this is your mother.</p><p>I am rapidly reaching the end of my patience with you.</p><p>Where are you? Are you at a bar?</p><p>Andrew? Andrew?</p><p>Mom? - He hung up on me.</p><p>What are you gonna do?</p><p>Heath. Lan. Andrew.</p><p>Mom, how did you even know I was here?</p><p>You went in my room? - You think that&#39;s bad?</p><p>Tomorrow morning, I&#39;m cleaning it.</p><p>Oh, by the way, Heath.</p><p>I didn&#39;t get a chance to tell you,</p><p>that was a lovely solo last week at church.</p><p>Thank you. We&#39;re out of here.</p><p>I hope it wasn&#39;t something I said.</p><p>Well, Andrew, shall we?</p><p>You just humiliated me in front of my friends.</p><p>I&#39;m not going anywhere with you. - Fine.</p><p>What are you doing? - I&#39;m staying for the show.</p><p>I&#39;m dying to see what all the fuss is about.</p><p>Excuse me, waitress. I&#39;ll have a glass of your house Chardonnay.</p><p>Of course, ma&#39;am.</p><p>I&#39;m curious. Andrew,</p><p>as you fantasize about this woman,</p><p>do you ever stop and think how</p><p>she came to be on this runway?</p><p>That&#39;s someone&#39;s little girl.</p><p>And that someone probably had a lot of dreams for her.</p><p>Dreams that did not include a thong and a pole.</p><p>It&#39;s not going to work, ok? I&#39;m not budging.</p><p>God knows what she&#39;s had to deal with in life.</p><p>Abject poverty, drugs, domestic violence,</p><p>maybe even molestation.</p><p>Mom!</p><p>Now she treats herself the way</p><p>other men treat her. Like an object. A piece of meat.</p><p>That does it. Kid, get her out of here.</p><p>She&#39;s killing it for the rest of us.</p><p>We&#39;re not here, leave a message.</p><p>It&#39;s Mrs. Huber, Susan, are you there?</p><p>I can see your lights are on.</p><p>I hope you&#39;re not screening. That&#39;s so tacky.</p><p>Listen. I need to talk to you.</p><p>My water heater just burst</p><p>and it&#39;s gonna cost me $600 to get a new one.</p><p>And I can&#39;t afford that.</p><p>I&#39;m just beside myself. Call me as soon as you get in.</p><p>Julie, honey, wake up.</p><p>We need to talk.</p><p>Can&#39;t this wait until morning?</p><p>I think I&#39;m being blackmailed.</p><p>And when I realized I couldn&#39;t put out the fire, I ran.</p><p>I must&#39;ve dropped the measuring cup in the process.</p><p>Why do I even let you out of the house?</p><p>Obviously, I can&#39;t let her get away with this.</p><p>The only thing to do is go to the police</p><p>and tell them what happened.</p><p>You can&#39;t do that.</p><p>Julie, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll throw me in jail.</p><p>I mean, it was an accident.</p><p>Dad won&#39;t care if it was an accident.</p><p>You know he&#39;ll just use this as an excuse to reopen custody.</p><p>Mom, I don&#39;t want to live with dad. - I know.</p><p>I need to talk to you. - Cool. Sure.</p><p>You were working tuesday, right? - Yeah.</p><p>You remember the cable guy showing up?</p><p>And you usually work till what time, five?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Damn it. That means he was in the house for four hours.</p><p>Wait. Now that I think about it,</p><p>I might not have seen him.</p><p>Either you saw him or you didn&#39;t. Which is it?</p><p>I didn&#39;t.</p><p>John...</p><p>...did my wife ask you to lie for her?</p><p>Mr. Solis, uh... I really don&#39;t want</p><p>to get in the middle of anything.</p><p>Thank you. That&#39;s all I needed to know.</p><p>Let&#39;s run through it one more time.</p><p>Mom, it&#39;s not brain surgery.</p><p>You&#39;ll stand guard while I crawl through Mrs. Huber&#39;s doggie door.</p><p>Once inside, I find the measuring cup.</p><p>Simple.</p><p>Mm, god. I hate that I&#39;m turning you into a little thief.</p><p>It&#39;s our cup. We&#39;re just taking back what&#39;s ours.</p><p>That&#39;s right. Ethically,</p><p>we have nothing to be ashamed about.</p><p>Oh. Wear these. I don&#39;t want you to leave finger prints.</p><p>There she goes. Ok. Move.</p><p>Oh, so glad to be playing frisbee again.</p><p>Here you go. Coming at you</p><p>All right. Back up a little more. There you go.</p><p>Whoo! All right. Here we go.</p><p>Oh, my, whoops! You better go get that. Yeah. Hah!</p><p>Mike. - Hey, Susan.</p><p>I thought that was you.</p><p>Uh... Yeah. Julie and I are out tossing a frisbee around,</p><p>and it flew off into Mrs. Huber&#39;s back yard.</p><p>Oh, you need some help?</p><p>No, no, no. Julie&#39;s got it.</p><p>Ok. I&#39;m glad I ran into you.</p><p>I wanted to make sure things were ok between us.</p><p>The other day, you seemed kind of distant.</p><p>Distant? What do you mean?</p><p>I mean, you&#39;re not mad at me for some reason, are you?</p><p>No. No, not at all.</p><p>Good. &#39;cause I&#39;m gonna take one more shot.</p><p>I got tickets for a Billy Wilder retrospective,</p><p>Wednesday night.</p><p>I&#39;d love to take you with me.</p><p>You are so sweet. I&#39;d love to go.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Eddie, I thought you&#39;d be at work.</p><p>I&#39;m not feeling well.</p><p>I got a sunburn the other day washing my car.</p><p>Well, don&#39;t just run off. Come and hang out with us.</p><p>Boy, you are one sick ticket. - What?</p><p>It&#39;s not bad enough I have to watch</p><p>you throw yourself at him every day.</p><p>Now you want to make sure I see it up close and personal?</p><p>No, it&#39;s not like that. - I&#39;ve got to take off.</p><p>I&#39;ll call about Wednesday night, ok?</p><p>Edie, wait.</p><p>Mike and I were gonna go see the movies on Wednesday</p><p>and I thought it would be fun if you joined us.</p><p>You want me to come with you? - Yeah.</p><p>Yeah, that&#39;s ok, isn&#39;t it, Mike?</p><p>Well, it&#39;s a limited engagement.</p><p>And it&#39;s sold out. I&#39;ve only got two tickets.</p><p>Edie, wait. You should take my ticket.</p><p>Really? Is that ok with you, Mike?</p><p>Uh, yeah, sure.</p><p>So, uh, what time do you want to pick me up?</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>You think you can have sex with anyone you want, huh?</p><p>Carlos couldn&#39;t help but feel proud of himself.</p><p>After all, he&#39;d just defended his honor.</p><p>Or had he?</p><p>Are you gay? - Yes. Is that why you&#39;re doing this?</p><p>&quot;Will you buy some chocolates?&quot;</p><p>Ladies.</p><p>Hey, Paul, what&#39;s up?</p><p>I wanted to apologize for my outburst yesterday.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about it. We unloaded a lot on you.</p><p>I suppose you&#39;re wondering why I</p><p>reacted so violently to that note.</p><p>It did... cross our minds.</p><p>Well, the truth is, Mary Alice was not a well person.</p><p>She was very troubled.</p><p>Troubled? - At first it was harmless.</p><p>She&#39;d leave herself notes, reminders like,</p><p>&quot;pick up the milk&quot;</p><p>or &quot;Zach has a dentist appointment.&quot;</p><p>But over time the notes became ugly.</p><p>Hateful messages started showing up.</p><p>Mary Alice was writing them to me,</p><p>to Zach, to herself.</p><p>Really? - That&#39;s why I lost it.</p><p>I was reminded of what Zach and I had been through.</p><p>Paul, I&#39;m so sorry. - We had no idea.</p><p>No.</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;d appreciate it</p><p>if you kept this to yourselves.</p><p>For Zach&#39;s sake. - Of course. Of course.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>I think he&#39;s lying. - Huh. So do I.</p><p>You didn&#39;t get me! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Boys, could you get in here, please?</p><p>He broke my plane. - I did not.</p><p>We&#39;ll talk about that later. I need you to take medicine.</p><p>Are we sick?</p><p>Not exactly. There is a special medicine.</p><p>It&#39;s like a vitamin and you&#39;ll take it every day, ok?</p><p>Stay right there.</p><p>Now open up.</p><p>Here, you... - No.</p><p>Guys, this is a... guys, here... - Nope.</p><p>In that moment, Lynette made a decision.</p><p>When it came to dealing with her children,</p><p>medication was no longer an option.</p><p>Of course, given her continuing level of frustration,</p><p>Lynette also felt a little</p><p>self-medication couldn&#39;t hurt.</p><p>So what&#39;s your strategy?</p><p>Are you just never gonna speak to me again?</p><p>Something like that.</p><p>I suppose I do owe you an apology.</p><p>Careful. I wouldn&#39;t want you to strain yourself.</p><p>I shouldn&#39;t have lied to you about your father.</p><p>You two are old enough to handle the truth</p><p>and I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>Keep going.</p><p>I&#39;m mad at you for about 7,000 other things.</p><p>If you think I&#39;ll apologize for taking</p><p>you out of a strip club, you&#39;re wrong.</p><p>I consider it one of my finest moments.</p><p>Oh, Andrew.</p><p>I know you blame me</p><p>for what&#39;s happening with your father,</p><p>but it&#39;s not entirely my fault and</p><p>I need you to understand that.</p><p>I do.</p><p>I just... don&#39;t want him to leave.</p><p>Neither do I.</p><p>Mom. - Yeah?</p><p>When can I have my door back?</p><p>Three months.</p><p>Royal Oaks was the scene of a hate crime today.</p><p>Jonathan Lisco, local gay activist</p><p>and part-time female impersonator,</p><p>was brutally attacked in his home.</p><p>Lisco speculated the attack</p><p>was in response to his efforts</p><p>to secure same-sex partner insurance</p><p>coverage from his employer,</p><p>Cliffside cable.</p><p>Police are circulating this sketch of the assailant.</p><p>The circumstances speak for themselves.</p><p>I&#39;ve taken a strong stance with my company.</p><p>Is there something you want to ask me?</p><p>No.</p><p>You took it, didn&#39;t you?</p><p>Good evening, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>It&#39;s my own fault for not hiding the cup.</p><p>If you&#39;re capable of arson,</p><p>obviously you&#39;re capable of breaking and entering.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.

Nothing was taken.</p><p>Still, somebody broke in.

So?</p><p>Most women that shop a lot, it&#39;s because</p><p>they don&#39;t have anything better to do.</p><p>What&#39;s your point? - Well, if you had children...</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>I&#39;m just saying that children give your life a purpose.</p><p>You&#39;re so busy taking care of them</p><p>you don&#39;t have time to wonder if you&#39;re happy.</p><p>You know, Juanita, this is so like you.</p><p>I invite you on a nice shopping</p><p>trip and you find ways to upset me.</p><p>You didn&#39;t invite me. I invited myself.</p><p>You keep looking at your watch.</p><p>Is there some place you have to be?</p><p>No! And I am not one of those</p><p>women who has a hole in her heart</p><p>that can only be filled by a baby.</p><p>I like my life a lot. It&#39;s very fulfilling.</p><p>Excuse my daughter-in-law. She&#39;s very fulfilled.</p><p>So he just blew you off?</p><p>I told him another man asked me out.</p><p>It was a perfect opportunity for</p><p>Mike to be jealous, and nothing.</p><p>Did you bat your eyes? It doesn&#39;t work if you don&#39;t bat your eyes.</p><p>I batted everything that wasn&#39;t nailed down. Nothing.</p><p>Thanks. - So what&#39;s going on there?</p><p>Gophers.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry about Mike. I know you like him.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s my fault.</p><p>Maybe I just imagined an entire relationship</p><p>with this man that didn&#39;t exist.</p><p>There has been flirting. I have seen it.</p><p>And the flirting made me think he was kind,</p><p>trustworthy, honest and hygienic.</p><p>A guy just smiles at me three times</p><p>and I&#39;m picking out wedding china.</p><p>I&#39;m a mess.</p><p>But to be fair, that&#39;s part of your charm.</p><p>That&#39;s what happened with Karl.</p><p>I only dated him a couple of months.</p><p>I filled in the blankets, I married him.</p><p>It was a disaster.</p><p>You think Mike is a Karl in disguise?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. What does that mean anyway?</p><p>&quot;My life is complicated.&quot;</p><p>If I wanted to sit around and wait for nothing,</p><p>I could do it on the can.</p><p>You&#39;re late. What&#39;s with the face?</p><p>I screwed up. I broke into the</p><p>Frome house and almost got caught.</p><p>What&#39;s &quot;almost&quot;?</p><p>I accidentally left something behind with my prints on it.</p><p>Did you ever hear of gloves? - It&#39;s the suburbs.</p><p>I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d matter.</p><p>Anyway, the police are running</p><p>a check and I&#39;m in the system.</p><p>I gotta pull up stakes before they come looking for me.</p><p>That&#39;s a sweet sound. Laughter like that, huh?</p><p>Pisses me off.</p><p>If and when your cover is blown, you disappear.</p><p>Until then, you keep fixing the neighbors&#39; pipes.</p><p>The more time I spend at this town,</p><p>the more I think we&#39;re making a mistake.</p><p>These are nice people.</p><p>My money says one of them isn&#39;t.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>No more screw-ups.</p><p>I&#39;m getting something to drink. Do you want something?</p><p>Don&#39;t be mad. - I waited for three hours for you.</p><p>I had to use a month&#39;s worth of</p><p>lunch money to pay for that room.</p><p>It&#39;s not my fault.</p><p>Juanita hasn&#39;t let me out of her sight since she got here.</p><p>Really?

I said I was sorry.</p><p>Just so you know,</p><p>I&#39;ve turned down half the pep-squad for you.</p><p>You can&#39;t be serious.</p><p>I&#39;m starting to think that... maybe I</p><p>should be with someone my own age.</p><p>I thought teenage girls bored you, John.</p><p>I thought what we had was beyond that.</p><p>so did I.</p><p>Why go back to something you don&#39;t want?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. - Maybe you&#39;re tired of me.</p><p>No. I want to be with you.</p><p>Then why are we arguing?</p><p>Gabrielle! - Damn it!</p><p>The virgin gave it up already?</p><p>I want you so bad.</p><p>When can I see you again? - Tomorrow.</p><p>Meet me at the mall after school.</p><p>What about your mother-in-law? - I&#39;ll think of something.</p><p>Gabrielle! Gabrielle! - Coming!</p><p>A donation? Now Barcliff wants a donation?</p><p>Apparently we&#39;re in competition with one other family.</p><p>A generous donation will ensure our kids beat &#39;em out.</p><p>How generous? - 15 thousand.</p><p>We don&#39;t have that. - That&#39;s what I told them.</p><p>So what will we do? Public school is</p><p>out unless we move to a new district.</p><p>We&#39;re not moving.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s time that we look into home schooling.</p><p>I know you did not just say that.</p><p>Honey, it&#39;s got its advantages.</p><p>Kids at home school do better in their later years.</p><p>They won&#39;t make it to their later years</p><p>if I have to spend all day with them.</p><p>Honey, sometimes you&#39;ve just got to make the sacrifice.</p><p>It&#39;s probably the best thing for the kids.</p><p>Why don&#39;t we just put them back in me and cook</p><p>them until they&#39;re civilized.</p><p>You&#39;d be cool with that?</p><p>I&#39;ve never had plum pudding before.</p><p>I&#39;m serving it for christmas.</p><p>I like to try out new recipes before the actual holiday.</p><p>That way, if the cookbook&#39;s gotten it wrong, I can fix it.</p><p>You must really like Christmas.</p><p>You and Mr. Van de Kamp always have the best decorations.</p><p>I adore the holidays.</p><p>I never get depressed if there&#39;s a decorated tree.</p><p>My mom and I would always decorate our tree together.</p><p>This Christmas is gonna be weird. - Oh, Zach.</p><p>You know, my mother died when I</p><p>was young. She was hit by a car.</p><p>It was right before Christmas, as a matter of fact.</p><p>We were all singing carols and the dog was howling</p><p>because everybody in my family sings off-key except for me.</p><p>Anyway, it was a terrible ruckus.</p><p>So no one noticed when my mother went</p><p>out to give the neighbors a gift.</p><p>The next thing we heard were brakes screeching.</p><p>Most of my family went to the hospital</p><p>but I stayed home because I was so young.</p><p>When I looked out the window</p><p>I saw my mother&#39;s blood on the street</p><p>and nobody was doing anything about it.</p><p>So I got a hose and I washed it off.</p><p>And once it was clean, I felt so much better.</p><p>I&#39;ve never told anyone that story before.</p><p>Those are the most interesting ones.</p><p>The stories that we never tell anyone.</p><p>Yeah. You&#39;re probably right.</p><p>I have one.</p><p>It&#39;s more of a secret really.</p><p>I know why my mom killed herself.</p><p>You do? - It was something I did.</p><p>Something bad.</p><p>What did you do, Zach?</p><p>Zach. Sweetheart.</p><p>No. I shouldn&#39;t have said anything.</p><p>If my dad found out...</p><p>I won&#39;t tell your father!</p><p>I can&#39;t get you involved.</p><p>Zachary, it&#39;s all right!</p><p>I can&#39;t believe Zach said that.</p><p>What else did Zach tell you?</p><p>Just that Mary Alice killed herself</p><p>because of something he&#39;d done.</p><p>You couldn&#39;t get any more out of him?</p><p>Oh, I tried, but he was so nervous.</p><p>He actually started shaking then he just left.</p><p>Ok, this is getting really weird.</p><p>I think we should go to the police.</p><p>And tell them what?</p><p>We don&#39;t even have the note any more. We gave it to Paul.</p><p>You have to get Zach to tell you something</p><p>so we have more to go on.</p><p>Girls, You don&#39;t understand.</p><p>This poor kid is scared out of his mind.</p><p>Bree, for god&#39;s sakes, you&#39;re a woman.</p><p>Manipulate him. That&#39;s what we do.</p><p>But how?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. How did you usually manipulate Rex?</p><p>Hello, Zachary.</p><p>Are you free for dinner tonight?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Oh, good. Because last night you</p><p>put me in such a holiday mood.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna make roast turkey and candy yams and eggnog.</p><p>Have you ever had real, old-fashioned eggnog?</p><p>I don&#39;t think so. - You are gonna love it.</p><p>It has quite a kick.</p><p>Mine!</p><p>Preston! - Boys, could you stop...</p><p>Lynette was desperate to avoid home schooling.</p><p>But she saw no options on the horizon.</p><p>Until a solution sailed into view.</p><p>Gabrielle, please. You bought me enough things.</p><p>You&#39;re the one who&#39;s supposed to be shopping.</p><p>Mama, you&#39;re in a rut.</p><p>We need to spice up your wardrobe. Ooh. Here.</p><p>Try this one on. Go on. Try it on.</p><p>Mama Solis, how are you doing in there?</p><p>Is it supposed to be so tight?</p><p>Yes, it&#39;s form-fitting. You&#39;ll look great.</p><p>Gabrielle, I don&#39;t think this dress is right for me.</p><p>I can&#39;t breathe.</p><p>Well, maybe I made a mistake.</p><p>While you change,</p><p>I&#39;m gonna make a quick run to the book store.</p><p>Wait! I&#39;m coming with you!</p><p>No! I&#39;ll just be a minute!</p><p>I&#39;m coming with you!</p><p>Wait!</p><p>Gabrielle! Wait! - Ma&#39;am!</p><p>Ma&#39;am. Sorry, I&#39;m gonna need to look in your bags, please.</p><p>Fine. Just hurry up.</p><p>Right on time.</p><p>I don&#39;t know where that blouse came from.</p><p>Security. - Keep your stupid blouse.</p><p>I have to find my daughter-in-law.</p><p>Don&#39;t touch me. Don&#39;t you dare touch me!</p><p>Ma&#39;am, you have to come with us.</p><p>Get your hands off me! Gabrielle!</p><p>Hello.</p><p>Hey, it&#39;s me. - Oh, hi, Rex. How are you?</p><p>Is something wrong?</p><p>I was just about to grab dinner from that motel vending machine</p><p>and it occurred to me, &quot;what the heck? I&#39;ll go out.&quot;</p><p>Would you like to have dinner with me?</p><p>Mrs. Van de Kamp. Guess what.</p><p>I found all my mom&#39;s old Christmas stuff.</p><p>Oh. Sweetie, I was just coming over to talk to you.</p><p>I am so sorry but something important</p><p>came up and I have to cancel.</p><p>Really? - We&#39;ll do it again.</p><p>We&#39;ll have our impromptu holiday dinner. I promise.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>Mm. I got one. Kelly Halstatter.</p><p>In eighth grade, she used to spit in my gym shoes.</p><p>Kelly Halstatter.</p><p>Kelly Halstatter. Here, look.</p><p>Two duis, one check-kiting and an open bench warrant.</p><p>How tragic. By which I mean, &quot;yay&quot;.</p><p>You&#39;ve been a good sport coming on my shift with me.</p><p>Well, time flies when you&#39;re on a stakeout in cracktown.</p><p>So when does our official date begin?</p><p>Taxpayers say 20 minutes. But I say now.</p><p>They&#39;re down. - Thank you.</p><p>Honey, you read up on home schooling?</p><p>Yeah. It gave me some good ideas.</p><p>Well, one, anyway.</p><p>Great. What have you got?</p><p>You know how we both agree that one of us</p><p>needs to stay home and parent the kids</p><p>and one of us needs to make a living?</p><p>And then I suddenly remembered that when I was working</p><p>I made a little more than you.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>You tossed out that little sacrifice comment a while ago.</p><p>It occurred to me, I&#39;ve made</p><p>sacrifices over the past six years.</p><p>I gave up my career.</p><p>If another sacrifice has to be made,</p><p>I think it&#39;s your turn on the man go round.</p><p>Lynette? - So if I went back to work,</p><p>you could stay home and take care of the kids.</p><p>I can&#39;t be with the kids all day. I&#39;d lose my mind.</p><p>Hey. Ok, I get it. Home schooling is out.</p><p>How are we gonna scrape together</p><p>15 grand for this endowment?</p><p>Mm. How, how, how...</p><p>Think. Think real hard.</p><p>Oh, no. - Aye-aye.</p><p>The restaurant&#39;s run by this little old guy named Arinello.</p><p>He will propose to you. Don&#39;t say yes</p><p>because he&#39;s dead serious.</p><p>But what if I like him?</p><p>Hey. I thought this went to the lab.</p><p>All right. You got me.</p><p>And that means what? - Look, Susan.</p><p>No one would authorize lab time or a</p><p>computer search for a case like this.</p><p>It&#39;s just not a priority. - So why</p><p>couldn&#39;t you just tell me that?</p><p>Well, I thought we were clicking.</p><p>Does this need to be a big deal?</p><p>Well, if you&#39;d only lied to me about it once it wouldn&#39;t be.</p><p>All right. I get it. You want me to beg. Ok.</p><p>Look at me. I&#39;m begging.</p><p>Come on. Don&#39;t be such a girl about this.</p><p>I know who you are. You&#39;re a Karl in disguise.</p><p>I&#39;m done with you. All of you.</p><p>Oh, come on, drama queen. What are you doing?</p><p>Where are you going? It&#39;s not safe.</p><p>I&#39;d rather take my chances on the street,</p><p>thank you very much.</p><p>Why do I always pick the psychos?</p><p>Excuse me. I&#39;m a little lost.</p><p>You best be lost. This here&#39;s my corner.</p><p>Oh, yes. And a lovely corner it is.</p><p>And I hate to bother you while you&#39;re working.</p><p>I was just wondering if you</p><p>point me in the direction of a payphone?</p><p>Oh, if you have some change for</p><p>this five. Preferably quarters.</p><p>Honey, if I got paid in quarters,</p><p>I&#39;d be doing something very wrong.</p><p>Right. Ok.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Hey. You want to use my cell? I have weekend minutes.</p><p>Thank you so much. You&#39;re saving my life.</p><p>Excuse me, honey. - Oh, yes. You do what you&#39;ve got to do.</p><p>Oh, please answer. Come on. Pick up, Julie.</p><p>Oh, thank god. Don&#39;t ask any questions.</p><p>Just get somebody down here to pick me</p><p>up at the corner of Ninth and Foster.</p><p>Hey, babe.</p><p>Thank you. No. I&#39;m on a break.</p><p>Hurry, please.</p><p>Excuse me. We got a call. Something about a break-in.</p><p>One of your neighbors was reporting seeing someone</p><p>forcing his way into your home.</p><p>We sent some guys out to investigate and uh...</p><p>What is it? - I gotta tell you, ma&#39;am.</p><p>I thought I&#39;d seen a lot on the job,</p><p>but this is something else.</p><p>So let me get this straight.</p><p>He chopped down one of our pine trees?</p><p>I&#39;m afraid so.</p><p>Zach, why did you do this?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. - Take off those handcuffs, please.</p><p>Ma&#39;am, he confessed to breaking in.</p><p>This is not up for discussion.</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>Sir, you can&#39;t...</p><p>Zach.</p><p>Are you ok? - Yeah.</p><p>Then how much for a trip around the world?</p><p>I can&#39;t believe Julie sent you. She is soon gonna be dead.</p><p>Come on. Get in.</p><p>Wasn&#39;t that sent in for prints?</p><p>No. The cop lied to me.</p><p>I don&#39;t wanna talk about it. - Just asking.</p><p>Yes. Apparently they found a blouse in her bag.</p><p>I don&#39;t know, Carlos. At some point</p><p>older people start to get confused.</p><p>She probably thought she paid for it.</p><p>No, no charges. Everything&#39;s fine.</p><p>Ok. I&#39;ll tell her. Bye.</p><p>Carlos is gonna be late for dinner. It&#39;s just the two of us.</p><p>What would you like to eat? - I&#39;m not hungry.</p><p>Ok. Suit yourself.</p><p>Don&#39;t go yet. I need to talk to you.</p><p>It&#39;s important. Please.</p><p>I married Diego Solis when I was 16 years old.</p><p>A few months into our marriage, he started to beat me.</p><p>I was so young as to but I didn&#39;t know what to do.</p><p>Juanita, I had no idea.</p><p>It got so bad that I started praying to god to let me die.</p><p>But god, in his infinite wisdom, gave me a reason to live.</p><p>Carlos.</p><p>Ah, he was a beautiful baby.</p><p>But my husband wasn&#39;t much of a father.</p><p>He never held him. He would yell and</p><p>scream at him for no reason at all.</p><p>One night, when Carlos was four,</p><p>Diego Solis came home drunk.</p><p>And he beat my Carlos.</p><p>Something inside me snapped.</p><p>At that moment, I found a way to be strong.</p><p>So I made sure that Diego Solis</p><p>never hurt my son or me ever again.</p><p>What did you do?</p><p>Well, if you pray hard enough,</p><p>God gives you the tools to your salvation.</p><p>Carlos said that his father left for a waitress in El Paso.</p><p>Mm-hm. That&#39;s what he was told.</p><p>All mothers know they have to protect their children.</p><p>But some of us take our job more seriously than others.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re telling me this.</p><p>I think you do.</p><p>Ok. I know you&#39;re mad at me.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t stop you from going out with that guy.</p><p>I&#39;m not mad at you. I mean I&#39;m not just mad at you.</p><p>I&#39;m mostly mad at myself.</p><p>Ok. - I&#39;m mad that I like you so much</p><p>without knowing anything about you.</p><p>Oh. What do you want to know?</p><p>What&#39;s your favorite food? - Mexican.</p><p>What&#39;s your favorite sport? - Football.</p><p>Favorite band? - Elvis Costello.</p><p>That&#39;s a guy, not a band.</p><p>It&#39;s a guy with a band.</p><p>What do you think of me?</p><p>I&#39;m sorry, could you repeat that?</p><p>I don&#39;t want to talk about it. - This is insane!</p><p>Do you even care about me? - Do not talk that way!</p><p>Mrs. Van de Kamp. - Hi, Zach.</p><p>I wanted to see if everything was all right.</p><p>Everything&#39;s fine. - Are you sure?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Well, ok. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow then.</p><p>I&#39;m sure that you will.</p><p>People by their very nature are always</p><p>on the lookout for intruders...</p><p>Trying to prevent those on the outside from getting in.</p><p>But there will always be those who</p><p>force their way into our lives,</p><p>just as there will be those we invite in.</p><p>But the most troubling of all</p><p>will be the ones who stand on the outside looking in.</p><p>The ones we never truly get to know.</p><h2 id="dh-se01-e06" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dh-se01-e06" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DH SE01 E06</h2><p>I know why my mom killed herself.</p><p>Secrets were revealed.</p><p>This is being really weird. I think we should go to the police.</p><p>Relationships got complicated.</p><p>Mama Solis. What are you doing here?</p><p>You think she&#39;s cheating on you? - I think so.</p><p>I will take care of it</p><p>We got a call, something about a break-in.</p><p>I thought I&#39;ve seen a lot on the job</p><p>but this is something else.</p><p>And the mystery... - Zach, why did you do this?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. - Depened.</p><p>Zach.</p><p>Suburbia is a battle ground,</p><p>an arena for all forms of domestic combat.</p><p>Husbands clash with wives,</p><p>parents cross swords with children.</p><p>But the bloodiest battles often involve women</p><p>and their mothers-in-law.</p><p>The war for control of Carlos began the night he proposed,</p><p>and Gabrielle had been losing ground to Juanita ever since.</p><p>From the prenuptial agrement which she reluctantly signed...</p><p>to the selection of wedding music she despised...</p><p>to the color of the house paint she hadn&#39;t wanted,</p><p>Gabrielle had suffered one defeat after another.</p><p>And now that Juanita suspected her</p><p>daughter-in-law of having an affair,</p><p>it had become increasingly apparent, in this war</p><p>Mrs. Solis, I&#39;ll be at the market.</p><p>No prisoners would be taken.</p><p>Thank you, Yao Lin.</p><p>I don&#39;t see why you have her.</p><p>It&#39;s a big house. I need help.</p><p>It&#39;s only called help</p><p>when you do some of the work yourself.</p><p>I supervise.</p><p>You pay her $300 a week.</p><p>That&#39;s $15,000 a year.</p><p>Carlos, you always say you&#39;re not</p><p>putting away enough for retirement.</p><p>Baby, it would be a good idea to cut back on expenses.</p><p>You want me to take care of this place alone?</p><p>Other women manage.</p><p>That&#39;s nice.</p><p>You like that? - Oh, yeah.</p><p>God, I&#39;m gonna miss this, Carlos.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>Well, since I&#39;m gonna have to be doing the cooking</p><p>and the cleaning and all the shopping like the other wives,</p><p>I&#39;m gonna be exhausted at night,</p><p>just like all the other wives.</p><p>Till I build up my stamina, of course.</p><p>And that might take a couple of years.</p><p>Sadly for Juanita,</p><p>she had ignored the first rule of war...</p><p>Good morning, Carlos. - The maid stays.</p><p>Never underestimate your enemy.</p><p>Of the many suburban rituals,</p><p>none is quite so cherished as the neighborhood yard sale.</p><p>The shoppers come to sift through</p><p>the discarded belongings of someone they don&#39;t really know,</p><p>in hopes of finding bargains they don&#39;t really need,</p><p>each so determined to save a few pennies</p><p>They often miss hidden treasures.</p><p>Hey, Paul. - Hi, Susan.</p><p>I was a little surprised to see Mary Alice&#39;s award for sale.</p><p>She got it for doing charity work from the Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Zach and I are moving.</p><p>We don&#39;t need to carry any more than is necessary.</p><p>That makes sense.</p><p>I just wanted to make sure you didn&#39;t want it for Zach.</p><p>Something to remember his mother by.</p><p>Zach doesn&#39;t need a piece of glass to remember his mother.</p><p>I&#39;m out of newspaper. Here.</p><p>Let&#39;s call it ten bucks for everything.</p><p>Great. Speaking of Zach... I haven&#39;t seen him around lately.</p><p>He&#39;s been a bit depressed.</p><p>I thought he could use a change of scenery,</p><p>so I sent him to stay with relatives.</p><p>Oh. Which ones? - You don&#39;t know them.</p><p>How did you get the fat lip? - The usual way</p><p>asking too many questions.</p><p>Did you find out where Zach is? - No.</p><p>But I can tell this much you he&#39;s not staying with relatives.</p><p>She&#39;s driven me crazy, mama.</p><p>It could be any one of these guys she&#39;s having an affair with.</p><p>Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m not letting her out of my sight.</p><p>Who the hell is that?</p><p>Look the way she is touching him.</p><p>Do you think that&#39;s the guy she&#39;s having an affair with?</p><p>Carlos, don&#39;t be stupid with that.</p><p>A guy she talks to in public</p><p>isn&#39;t someone you&#39;re gonna worry about.</p><p>So it&#39;s someone that she doesn&#39;t talk to.</p><p>What I have to do, beat up every guy in town?</p><p>Marriage takes work.</p><p>I&#39;m not surprise that he&#39;s playing it close to the vest.</p><p>Paul knows we&#39;re onto him.</p><p>Zach said Mary Alice killed herself</p><p>because of something he&#39;d done. Something bad.</p><p>Is there anyone else who&#39;d know what he was talking about?</p><p>No. That&#39;s why we have to find him.</p><p>It&#39;s the only way we&#39;ll know the truth.</p><p>It just doesn&#39;t make any sense. Zach is such a sweet kid.</p><p>I can&#39;t imagine him doing anything that terrible.</p><p>He did break into your house.</p><p>I mean the kid&#39;s obviously troubled in some way.</p><p>Severe depression, borderline personality disorder.</p><p>Zach is a deeply troubled young man. - I&#39;m aware of that.</p><p>What are you giving him?</p><p>Antidepressants and a mood stabilizer.</p><p>Good.</p><p>I&#39;m also recommending extensive psychotherapy</p><p>to help unearth any repressed memory.</p><p>I don&#39;t think so.</p><p>Mr. Young, I can&#39;t just medicate him indefinitely.</p><p>Forget the Freud and stick with the drugs.</p><p>No new treatments without my permission.</p><p>Great version of little red riding hood.</p><p>It is your involvement</p><p>that makes the plays here at Barcliff Academy so special.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>I would like to turn over the next part of our meeting</p><p>to our parent coordinator, the amazing Maisy Gibbons.</p><p>Thank you, Miss Truesdale. Now before everyone leaves,</p><p>we have new copies of the script up here.</p><p>Tilda and Frances and I went to the rehearsal yesterday,</p><p>and we were a little troubled by the ending.</p><p>Killing the wolf. It sends the wrong message to our kids.</p><p>We believe that animals should only</p><p>be euthanized as a last resort.</p><p>Do you find something amusing?</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I thought you were kidding.</p><p>No. - Oh. Ok.</p><p>In our version, the wolf is aggressive</p><p>because he has a thorn in his paw,</p><p>and the woodsman will take out the</p><p>thorn and send Mr. Wolf on his way.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. Aren&#39;t we doing little red riding hood?</p><p>Yes. - So then you are aware that the wolf is a bad guy.</p><p>He eats little red&#39;s grandma.</p><p>If you let him go, he&#39;s gonna chow</p><p>down on other defenseless old ladies.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. And you are?</p><p>I&#39;m Lynette Scavo.</p><p>My twins just joined. They&#39;re playing oak trees.</p><p>Oh, of course. Lynette.</p><p>Let&#39;s see. You are signed up to</p><p>take tickets the night of the show, is that right?</p><p>Yeah. - Well, with all due respect,</p><p>let&#39;s leave the creative suggestions</p><p>to the mothers who have assumed the heavy lifting. Shall we?</p><p>Sure. Whatever.</p><p>I must say I&#39;m jealous of how</p><p>much time you two spend together.</p><p>My mother-in-law would never want</p><p>to hang out with me all day.</p><p>She sounds nice.</p><p>Hey there, you two.</p><p>Hi, John.</p><p>Mrs. Solis.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t aware you two were friends.</p><p>We go to the same school. - Of course you do.</p><p>Mama, if you need anything.</p><p>We&#39;ll be upstairs in my room studying.</p><p>Have fun.</p><p>Doesn&#39;t it make you nervous?</p><p>A boy alone upstairs with Danielle?</p><p>Oh, no. I don&#39;t worry about John.</p><p>Both he and Danielle are in the abstinence club.</p><p>Coffee&#39;s a little hot.</p><p>Susan was infuriated by Paul&#39;s evasive answers.</p><p>She was convinced he was deliberately hiding Zach</p><p>and hiding the truth.</p><p>She hoped that finding one would lead to the other.</p><p>To succeed, Susan would have to be evasive herself.</p><p>Susan. Long time no see. - Mrs. Greenberg.</p><p>Do you remember those two eggs</p><p>I let you borrow last Christmas?</p><p>I need those back. - Gosh, honey, I&#39;m fresh out.</p><p>But if you want, I could run to the store.</p><p>Oh, forget about it. It&#39;s not that important.</p><p>But since I&#39;m here, do you still have</p><p>that old hatchback sitting in your garage?</p><p>Can I borrow it tomorrow? - You want to borrow my car?</p><p>Just for a couple of hours.</p><p>I&#39;m not sure. Do you know how to drive a stick?</p><p>Yes, I think so. I learned in college.</p><p>It&#39;s like riding a bike, right?</p><p>I&#39;m not sure, dear.</p><p>It&#39;s no big deal. It&#39;s just for a couple of hours.</p><p>I let you borrow my eggs for a whole year.</p><p>Fist off, I&#39;m very pleased with the work we&#39;ve</p><p>done in our sessions thus far.</p><p>We&#39;re making excellent progress.</p><p>Thank you. I feel good about it.</p><p>But there are a few areas of your</p><p>marriage we haven&#39;t covered yet.</p><p>Oh, really? Like what?</p><p>I&#39;ve told Dr. Goldfine in our private sessions</p><p>that I&#39;m not happy with our sex life.</p><p>And Rex feels that when the two of you have intercourse,</p><p>you&#39;re not as connected as you could be.</p><p>Connected? - Yeah.</p><p>Like you&#39;re thinking about other things.</p><p>Is your hair getting messed up?</p><p>Did you buy the toothpaste? You&#39;re just not there.</p><p>This kind of disconnect is often</p><p>a symptom of a deeper problem.</p><p>So we were talking and the idea</p><p>of a sexual surrogate came up.</p><p>This is a licensed professional</p><p>who&#39;d work with you as a couple</p><p>on solving whatever sexual problems you may be having.</p><p>I have an excellent referral.</p><p>And what would this sexual surrogate person do?</p><p>She would coach us. - She?</p><p>She&#39;s very discreet. You&#39;ll hardly notice she&#39;s there.</p><p>Oh. So she would be in the room with us</p><p>while we make love?</p><p>Yes. Helping us to achieve maximum sexual potential.</p><p>Do you have any questions? - Just one.</p><p>How much longer is your mid-life crisis going to last?</p><p>Because it is really starting to tick me off.</p><p>Right. Everyone&#39;s down for a nap.</p><p>We&#39;ve got no more than an hour. Let&#39;s get cracking.</p><p>Five-card draw. Nothing wild.</p><p>How is it going with mike, Susan?</p><p>It&#39;s going, finally.</p><p>We have a first official date next week.</p><p>I think he&#39;s taking me to see a play or something.</p><p>Might I suggest the Barcliff Academy</p><p>production of little red riding hood?</p><p>Oh, that&#39;s right. The twins&#39; stage debut.</p><p>Are they having fun?</p><p>Sure. They play oak trees.</p><p>I have to deal with the drama behind the scenes.</p><p>Oh, I take it you&#39;ve met Maisy Gibbons?</p><p>She&#39;s a total nightmare.</p><p>I guess I shouldn&#39;t have challenged her. - Oh, dear.</p><p>Because now no one on the play committee wants to talk to me.</p><p>Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.</p><p>Hasn&#39;t changed since girl scouts.</p><p>Girls smile at you to your face</p><p>and then behind your back, make fun of you &#39;cause</p><p>you&#39;re the only one not shaving your legs yet.</p><p>That wouldn&#39;t happen in boy scouts.</p><p>When I worked with men,</p><p>I preferred the way they fought.</p><p>A guy takes his opponent on face-to-face,</p><p>and once he&#39;s won, he&#39;s top dog.</p><p>It&#39;s primitive but it&#39;s fair.</p><p>And a lot less sneaky.</p><p>Isn&#39;t it sexist of us to generalize like this?</p><p>It&#39;s science, Gabrielle.</p><p>Sociologists have documented this stuff.</p><p>Well, who am I to argue with sociologists?</p><p>Wow, this guacamole has got a kick.</p><p>I&#39;m gonna run to the little girl&#39;s room.</p><p>You go ahead. I might be a while.</p><p>I hate playing three-handed poker. Let&#39;s take a break.</p><p>I&#39;ll play. - You play poker?</p><p>I used to play with my grandfather. - Pull up a chair.</p><p>You&#39;re just playing for chips?</p><p>My grandfather used to say</p><p>it&#39;s always more fun to play for money.</p><p>Why not? 50 cents a bet? - Make it a buck.</p><p>Three raise limit, $20 buy-in.</p><p>Mrs. Solis! What are you doing?</p><p>Why haven&#39;t you returned my calls?</p><p>I&#39;ve been busy. - I&#39;ve seen who you&#39;ve been busy with.</p><p>Danielle? Come on. She&#39;s just a friend.</p><p>Before you get any friendlier, let me remind you,</p><p>I can do things to you she can&#39;t even pronounce.</p><p>A lot of good it does me with your</p><p>mother-in-law following you around all the time.</p><p>Maybe we should just cool it for a while.</p><p>No, John, please don&#39;t say that.</p><p>I have everything under control.</p><p>Now give me a boost.</p><p>Hey. So what did I miss?</p><p>Not much. Just a few friendly hands of poker with the girls.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m late.</p><p>As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all heard,</p><p>Celia Bond broke her wrist playing tennis.</p><p>Which means we are now in desperate need</p><p>of someone to do the costumes.</p><p>I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed. Are there any volunteers?</p><p>I&#39;ll do it.</p><p>Really? That&#39;s a --Do you know how to sew?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Well, great. Thank you, Lynette.</p><p>Ok. So now that I&#39;m going to do some &quot;heavy lifting&quot;,</p><p>I believe I have the right to talk</p><p>about the changes made to the script?</p><p>Ladies.</p><p>We grew up with little red riding hood,</p><p>and survived it, scary stuff and all.</p><p>So I say to hell with political correctness.</p><p>Let our kids experience this classic</p><p>like it was meant to be enjoyed.</p><p>Let&#39;s kill the damn wolf and just</p><p>put on the best show we can.</p><p>Thank you, Lynette, for that impassioned speech.</p><p>But I believe that ship has sailed. - No! It hasn&#39;t.</p><p>We still have time to change the ending back.</p><p>And you know, Maisy, it is just a fairy tale.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it will upset the children.</p><p>I think you&#39;re wrong.</p><p>That&#39;s what&#39;s so great about democracy.</p><p>Everyone&#39;s entitled to their opinion.</p><p>Also, everyone has a right to vote.</p><p>So all in favor of the woodsman going</p><p>medieval on the big bad wolf&#39;s ass.</p><p>Dr. Goldfine.</p><p>Bree. - You&#39;re dining alone?</p><p>Actually, I am. - What a coincidence. So am I.</p><p>Seems a shame for us to eat by ourselves.</p><p>Shall I pull up a chair?</p><p>Bree, it&#39;s nothing personal,</p><p>but I never socialize with clients.</p><p>Oh, I get it. I&#39;m so sorry. Of course. It&#39;s inappropriate.</p><p>It&#39;s just that after what happened yesterday</p><p>there&#39;s so much I need to say because...</p><p>I suppose it can wait.</p><p>No, Lynette, I&#39;m sorry. Juanita&#39;s taking a bath.</p><p>How much did she win from you?</p><p>Jeez!</p><p>Yeah, I guess she&#39;ll take a check.</p><p>Ok. All right. Bye.</p><p>What was that about?</p><p>Turns out your mother is quite the card shark.</p><p>You let her play cards? How long did she play?</p><p>Not that long. Why?</p><p>Carlos, what is it?</p><p>I never told you this, but my mother</p><p>had a serious gambling problem.</p><p>Was this before we were married?</p><p>Yeah. It was bad.</p><p>She went into debt. Dipped into her savings,</p><p>started hocking jewelry.</p><p>Honey, it was only a small neighborhood game.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t take much for her to fall off the wagon.</p><p>I know she seems like a very strong woman but...</p><p>She has a major weakness.</p><p>Honey... Oh... It&#39;s ok.</p><p>You were right to tell me this.</p><p>And you understand I have to treat this as a session.</p><p>Of course. That&#39;s fine.</p><p>Shall I include the meal?</p><p>Oh, no. We&#39;ll split that.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>So let&#39;s talk about yesterday.</p><p>Do you think there might have</p><p>been some truth in what Rex said?</p><p>No, I don&#39;t.</p><p>Bree, you know. It&#39;s not uncommon for people experiencing</p><p>sexual repression to distance themselves during the act.</p><p>Is that how you see me?</p><p>As some sort of prude who just lays there like a cold fish?</p><p>I love sex. - All right.</p><p>I love everything about it. The sensations. The smells.</p><p>I especially love the feel of a man.</p><p>All that muscle and sinew pressed against my body.</p><p>And then when you add friction!</p><p>The tactile sensation of running my tongue</p><p>over a man&#39;s nipple ever so gently.</p><p>And then there&#39;s the act itself. Two bodies becoming one,</p><p>and that final eruption of pleasure.</p><p>To be honest. The only thing I don&#39;t like about sex is the scrotum.</p><p>Obviously it has its practical applications,</p><p>but I&#39;m not a fan.</p><p>Can I get you something?</p><p>Uh... Just the check, please.</p><p>Sir, you haven&#39;t ordered yet.</p><p>We&#39;re not shopping?</p><p>Oh, I thought we stop you for lunch first.</p><p>This place has the best buffet in town.</p><p>All-you-can-eat crab legs.</p><p>Oh, no! - What&#39;s wrong? Let&#39;s go.</p><p>Oh, I didn&#39;t realize how late it was.</p><p>They are only holding the suit minute for me until two.</p><p>If we stay I&#39;ll never make it.</p><p>We&#39;ll just have lunch at the mall.</p><p>Wait. Uh... I&#39;m really in the mood for crab legs.</p><p>Why don&#39;t you just drop me off and you can come back.</p><p>Well, if the mall is crowded it might take over an hour.</p><p>It&#39;s a buffet. There&#39;s no rush.</p><p>Hi, John. Motel. Ten minutes. Be there.</p><p>All right. Off you go. Thanks.</p><p>Lynette, I couldn&#39;t help notice</p><p>you forgot the coonskin on that hunter&#39;s coonskin cap.</p><p>Yeah. That was a creative call.</p><p>Look, I&#39;m in the middle of a costumes crisis.</p><p>If I don&#39;t take shortcuts I&#39;ll never finish.</p><p>Jordana Geist manages to get her work done.</p><p>She runs the concessions, paints the sets,</p><p>and still has time to take care of her three kids and a husband.</p><p>Now, we can&#39;t have the students suffer</p><p>just because you don&#39;t understand</p><p>the concept of time management.</p><p>I hardly think the kids are gonna suffer</p><p>without a clump of fur on their heads.</p><p>Ok. I&#39;ll make a creative call. We&#39;ll cut the oak trees.</p><p>That forest is looking a little dense anyway.</p><p>My boys are the oak trees. - Are they?</p><p>Well, I wouldn&#39;t worry.</p><p>We&#39;ll find something for them to do backstage.</p><p>That&#39;s where the real action is.</p><p>I&#39;ll finish the costumes. - Well. Crisis averted.</p><p>You have lost your mind. - I checked up on Silvercrest place.</p><p>It&#39;s a treatment center for troubled kids.</p><p>Who is gonna notice. One more,</p><p>I create the distraction, you blend in and find Zach.</p><p>How could I blend in with messed-up teenagers?</p><p>I don&#39;t know, Julie.</p><p>You pretend to be bulimic. Gag a little.</p><p>Come on. Work with me here.</p><p>Mama, when this is over,</p><p>we need to talk about your parenting skills.</p><p>Ok, fine. You don&#39;t want to help me,</p><p>I&#39;m not gonna force you.</p><p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to. It&#39;s just...</p><p>Why does this mean so much to you?</p><p>Because Mary Alice was a wonderful person.</p><p>And now all anybody thinks about her is that</p><p>she went off the deep end and did this terrible, selfish thing.</p><p>And I think there&#39;s more to it than that.</p><p>she was my friend, Julie,</p><p>and I owe it to her to find out the truth.</p><p>Juanita, what&#39;s wrong?</p><p>Juanita?</p><p>I didn&#39;t go to the buffet. I went gambling instead and I lost.</p><p>How much did you have on you? It couldn&#39;t have been much.</p><p>I used Carlos&#39; credit card.</p><p>Ok. How much did you charge?</p><p>I don&#39;t know. It stopped working.</p><p>What do you mean it stopped working?</p><p>This thing has like a $15,000 credit limit.</p><p>The man at the desk said there were no vacant rooms.</p><p>Mind if I bunk with you?</p><p>Bree, what are you doing here?</p><p>It&#39;s a little chilly out here.</p><p>Do you mind if we discuss this inside?</p><p>Come on in.</p><p>Sure is nice and toasty in here.</p><p>You look amazing. - Thanks.</p><p>I was hoping you&#39;d notice.</p><p>Well, it certainly isn&#39;t the Ritz,</p><p>but it has all the essentials.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what to say.</p><p>The perhaps you should say nothing.</p><p>Rex? Baby...</p><p>I just need a minute. - What?</p><p>Sweetie, just leave it, will you? Just leave it.</p><p>Ok, baby. Where were we?</p><p>I told you to leave it.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I just...</p><p>Oh, come on. Are you gonna make a big deal about this?</p><p>You know? To tell you the truth.</p><p>Now is not really a good time for me.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious you&#39;ve never had to remove a cheese stain.</p><p>Bree, I totally understand. Yeah, I already tried Susan.</p><p>And Gaby can&#39;t sew. Seriously, I&#39;m gonna be fine.</p><p>Yeah. Ow! Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m a little ahead with my painting.</p><p>If you need some help.</p><p>Oh, Jordana, you are a life-saver. Thank you.</p><p>Here. These pieces need trim.</p><p>I&#39;ll help for as long as I can,</p><p>but I have a lot on my plate tonight.</p><p>I have to make 25 mini Quiches for my book club.</p><p>You&#39;re not a human, are you?</p><p>You were sent by aliens to make humans race feel inadequate.</p><p>Seriously, how do you cram it all in?</p><p>Can you keep a secret? - Um... Sure.</p><p>That&#39;s ADD medication.</p><p>Oh, my kids take this or they almost did.</p><p>I thought it was supposed to calmed you down.</p><p>Has the opposite effect if you don&#39;t have ADD.</p><p>Ever chug a pot of Turkish coffee?</p><p>Seriously? You&#39;re taking your kids&#39; medication?</p><p>Once in a while. Do you want a couple?</p><p>Oh, that&#39;s very kind of you but I just</p><p>smoked some crack a little while ago. So.</p><p>I&#39;d better not mix.</p><p>This is what we will do. I&#39;ll sell some old jewelry.</p><p>Pay off the credit card, and Carlos will never find out.</p><p>You would do that for me?</p><p>Of course I would. Why wouldn&#39;t I?</p><p>For starters, you hate me.</p><p>Oh, that is overstating it... a little.</p><p>The bottom line is, no matter how much I dislike you,</p><p>I love Carlos more.</p><p>If Carlos finds out the money, he&#39;ll be devastated.</p><p>I don&#39;t wanna see him hurt.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to believe I&#39;m a good person,</p><p>but at least believe I care about my husband.</p><p>Fine. To heck with it.</p><p>I&#39;m not gonna risk my neck to protect you.</p><p>I&#39;m calling Carlos.</p><p>Juanita might have ben the gambler of the family...</p><p>Wait. I believe you.</p><p>...but Gabrielle was</p><p>the one who knew how to bluff.</p><p>Hi. I&#39;m Susan Mayer.</p><p>I have an appointment to see Dr. Sicher.</p><p>Yes, he&#39;s expecting you. Let me get him for you.</p><p>Hi. I&#39;m Dr. Sicher. - Susan Mayer.</p><p>So you&#39;re doing research for a children&#39;s book?</p><p>I sure am.</p><p>Zach?</p><p>Oh. Hi, Julie.</p><p>What&#39;s wrong with you?</p><p>Just all the pills they make me take.</p><p>They kinda make me sleepy.</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>I came to see how you were.</p><p>And to ask you something.</p><p>Look, I don&#39;t have much time.</p><p>What is it?</p><p>Last week you told Mrs. Van de Kamp</p><p>your mom killed herself</p><p>because of something you did, something bad.</p><p>What were you talking about?</p><p>After my mom died, I started remembering</p><p>things that happened when I was little.</p><p>What happened to Dana. - Dana? Who&#39;s Dana?</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>I was just visiting my friend.</p><p>This patient is not allowed visitors.</p><p>I guess I have to go.</p><p>I am so sorry, Zach.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to disturb you.</p><p>I just left some important papers here.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>I&#39;m repairing a chipped mug.</p><p>Why don&#39;t you just buy a new one?</p><p>Because I think it&#39;s better to fix what you already have.</p><p>Listen. Um...</p><p>About what happened today.</p><p>You humiliated me, Rex.</p><p>For no good reason.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. - I was there. I was willing.</p><p>Normal men don&#39;t say no to that.</p><p>You... You upset me.</p><p>See, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the reason.</p><p>After I left the motel,</p><p>I did some thinking about us and our sex life.</p><p>I realized there has been a disconnect.</p><p>But it&#39;s coming from you. - That&#39;s ridiculous.</p><p>how many years we&#39;ve been making love</p><p>and you&#39;ve started to ask me something</p><p>but then you stopped.</p><p>I... I don&#39;t know what you are talking about?</p><p>You are unhappy with our sex life</p><p>because you&#39;re not getting something from me</p><p>but you&#39;re simplely too afraid to ask.</p><p>My problem with our sex life is that you can&#39;t stop</p><p>thinking about the housework.</p><p>Well, if that&#39;s the case,</p><p>then take me right here, right now.</p><p>The house is spotless.</p><p>There are no burritos around to pull my focus.</p><p>I&#39;m not in the mood. - Why not?</p><p>We haven&#39;t had sex for months, Rex.</p><p>Most normal, red-blooded men</p><p>would be climbing the walls by now.</p><p>Please don&#39;t do this.</p><p>Rex, whatever you want.</p><p>I will go there with you. You just have to say it out loud.</p><p>Tell me. What do you want? What do you need?</p><p>I need for you to stop talking like this.</p><p>Why? - Because you sound like a whore.</p><p>No, I sound like a woman</p><p>whose husband won&#39;t touch her.</p><p>Rex, after Mary Alice killed herself,</p><p>it all hit me.</p><p>We all have our secrets.</p><p>I think it&#39;s time for you to tell me yours.</p><p>I&#39;m going.</p><p>That night, while most of Wisteria Lane</p><p>dreamt the night away,</p><p>Lynette was in the middle of her own personal nightmare.</p><p>Determined her boys would not miss their fairy-tale debut,</p><p>Lynette had stayed up 18 hours straight, sewing.</p><p>But she began to fear her story</p><p>would not have a happy ending.</p><p>Luckily for Lynette, she had a magic potion handy.</p><p>And once she had taken it...</p><p>The magic kept working...</p><p>And working...</p><p>And working.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t until noon that Lynette finally took a break,</p><p>and the reality of what she had done began to sink in.</p><p>My. What big eyes you have.</p><p>I&#39;m going to the store. Do you need anything?</p><p>I&#39;m fine, thank you.</p><p>So what&#39;s been going on with her?</p><p>Have you found anything out yet?</p><p>Actually, Carlos, the more I watch her, the more</p><p>I think she&#39;s probably not stepping out on you.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Yeah. She&#39;s not perfect, Lord knows.</p><p>But she loves you. I can tell.</p><p>Mama. You don&#39;t know what a relief it is to hear that.</p><p>You know, it&#39;s funny. I really think she loves you, too.</p><p>Oh?</p><p>I got concerned when I heard you</p><p>played poker with her friends.</p><p>So I told her about your little problem.</p><p>You told her about my gambling problem?</p><p>Don&#39;t be mad, Mama. I just didn&#39;t want</p><p>you slipping into old habits.</p><p>And Gabrielle was very concerned about you. - She knew?</p><p>I don&#39;t get it. You and Zach never went</p><p>to school with anybody named Dana.</p><p>He didn&#39;t say it was somebody we went to school with.</p><p>Did it sound like a relative?</p><p>He said Dana. It sounded like &quot;Dana&quot;.</p><p>Unless he was using a code,</p><p>that&#39;s all I got.</p><p>Ok, give me a break here. I&#39;m just grasping at straws.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m worried about Zach.</p><p>It&#39;s really creepy in there.</p><p>Can&#39;t we get him out?</p><p>Honey, that&#39;s up to his father.</p><p>Then I want to visit again.</p><p>That&#39;s not a good idea either.</p><p>Why?</p><p>I just have a feeling.</p><p>Juanita was now more convinced than ever</p><p>that her treacherous daughter-in-law was having an affair.</p><p>But the question remained, with whom?</p><p>And suddenly...</p><p>Juanita remembered</p><p>it wasn&#39;t the men Gabrielle talked to</p><p>that she had to worry about.</p><p>Hey, Jordana, Maisy.</p><p>Here are the costumes. Right on time.</p><p>Thank you, Lynette.</p><p>This is a bit awkward.</p><p>There has been an oversight with the programs.</p><p>Celia Bond is still credited with costumes.</p><p>They forgot to tell the printer.</p><p>Incidentally, who is &quot;they&quot;,</p><p>as in, &quot;they forgot to tell the printer&quot;?</p><p>That would be me. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p>But I was so overworked this week with</p><p>all the script changes you demanded.</p><p>Uh-huh. Well, these things happen.</p><p>Be right back.</p><p>Would you do something with this?</p><p>It looks like road kill.</p><p>Ok, lady, that&#39;s it.</p><p>I beg your pardon?</p><p>We have kids the same age.</p><p>Which means there&#39;re years ahead of us</p><p>having to deal with each other.</p><p>So instead of playing petty games,</p><p>why don&#39;t we put an end to this right now?</p><p>What are you saying? - Let&#39;s take it outside.</p><p>Let&#39;s take what outside?</p><p>Your sorry ass.
